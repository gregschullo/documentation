## DevOps Versus SRE

In short, SRE implements DevOps.  
DevOps is a means of breaking down organizational barriers to deliver more stable software with new features, faster.  

DevOps has five key components:  

1. break down silos
    - development and operations share ownership of production
1. accept failure as normal
    - blameless postmortems and error budgets
1. implement gradual change
    - move more minor changes more frequently to smaller fleets (canary releases)
1. leverage tooling and automation
    - automate this past years work away.
1. measure everything
    - measure toil and the reliability and health of the system
