## Quality Assurance and Test Engineering

Quality assurance (QA) and testing engineers create and implement strategies for finding flaws and problems before software is deployed to production systems. They are experts at automation, at designing tests, and at imagining potential problem areas and attack vectors. Their goal of ensuring consistent product quality marries well with the SRE goals and their experience helps them fit in to SRE teams quickly. They are often among the most astute chaos experiment designers and help teams find ways to be even more intentional about finding and fixing problems before anyone else does. Pair this with the slow move away from traditional QA testing, which really came of age during the era of waterfall software development, and moving from a dying field into the new frontier of testing at runtime and it makes a lot of sense for testing experts to apply their insights as SREs.
