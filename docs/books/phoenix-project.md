title: The Phoenix Project

**Part One**

## Chapter 1: Tuesday, September 2

- Bill Palmer, Director of Midrange Technology Operations
- responsible for availability of his IT group
- Do more with less, maintain competitiveness, and reduce costs
- IT systems should be reliable and available, and for the business to be able to depend on them

## Chapter 2: Tuesday, September 2

- Payroll issue is a giant dumpsterfire
- SAN issue should have affected more than it did.
- ask better questions for better results
- prioritization comes in to play here with which issues are to be tackled first

## Chapter 3: Tuesday, September 2

- Change to Social Security numbers caused issue in Payroll outage?
- Change management is IMPORTANT
- Didn't get Timekeeping app or SAN online on time. =(

## Chapter 4: Wednesday, September 3

- Managers arguing about who's fault the problem is and importance of the project
- Given 9 days to release project phoenix
- Issues caused by other issues
- They need more than one Brent (he is a bottleneck in the company's success)
- Bill's laptop upgrade fails, along with many others in the company
- TOO MUCH PAPERWORK FOR CHANGE CONTROL

## Chapter 5: Thursday, September 4

- Can't make new commitments to people without understanding what current commitments are
- When prioritizing, make sure you are aware of what is getting deprioritized

## Chapter 6: Friday, September 5

- What defines a change?
- Silly to dwell on sunk costs. Whether it be in time or money. Keep Rowing
- Employees get excited when processes are simple and they are empowered to do work.
- The amount of changes that flowed in due to the simplicity of the new note card change process is an example of this

## Chapter 7: Friday, September 5

- What is "work"
- WIP or Work In Progress (Inventory) - Silent Killer
- IT Operations is responsible for 4 types of work

1. Business Project Work
2. Internal IT Project Work
3. Change Work
4. Unplanned Work (Anti-Work)

- Theory of Constraints
- Lean Production or theToyota Production System
- Total Quality Management
- Bottlenecks must be accounted for FIRST. All other improvements are an illusion as they will always still be waiting on the bottleneck (and potentially making the bottleneck worse)
- The job of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so that we may provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.
- The Three Ways

1. The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into IT Operations, because that is what is between the business and the customer
2. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quaility at the source and avoid rework
3. The Third Way shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery

## Chapter 8: Monday, September 8

- Change Management Delegation

## Chapter 9: Tuesday, September 9

- Everything is documented in change management to ensure we know what is affected by our changes.

## Chapter 10: Thursday, September 11

- Brent is the only one who knows where to look to fix things
- No calls or tickets are logged because the paperwork takes longer than fixing the actual issue (this should be irrelevant... Ticket always)
- Document all fixes and add to knowledge base. Create a culture that embraces this.

## Chapter 11: Thursday, September 11

- Figuring our how to remove Brent as a bottleneck and challenges associated with it

## Chapter 12: Friday, September 12

- Terrible deployment of Phoenix is an understatement

## Chapter 13: Monday, September 15

- Credit card security codes are revealed
- Audits were not taken care of

## Chapter 14: Tuesday, September 16

- Threat to outsource IT
- Chris and Bill start to talk to one another to form a partnership between Dev and Operations

## Chapter 15: Wednesday, September 17

- First change management success
- DevOps is about minimizing unplanned work
- Unplanned work kills the ability to do planned work
-Murphy's Law :)There will always be unplanned work. Ability to handle unplanned work efficiently is extremely important.
- The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt
- 5 Focusing Steps

1. Identify Contraint(Identified Brent as Bottleneck early in the book)
2. Exploit the Constraint - make sure the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. Should never wait on any resource and should always be working on highest priority commitment
3. Subordinate (Adjust to) the Constraint 
- no sense in having things pile up in front of the bottleneck. Match the pace of what the bottleneck can handle until bottleneck is improved
4. Elevate the Constraint
5. Repeat the Process
- Optimizing until the current constraint is gone and you look for the next constraint in the system
- Incorporate Nonfunctional Requirements into design
- Brent knows the most about where technical debt exists and is needed in architecture and code built/designed for Operations meetings 
- Know what work matters to achieve business objectives

## Chapter 16: Thursday, September 18

- CEO Steve is threatening to make the situation worse again
- Bill quits his job?


**Part 2**

## Chapter 17: Monday, September 22

## Chapter18: Tuesday, September 23

- Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni

## Chapter 19: Tuesday, September 23

- analysis of demand capacity should be performed before accepting new work
- technical debt comes from taking short cuts
- when all you do is react, that leaves little time to do the mental work of planning

## Chapter 20: Friday, September 26

- Priority 1 is whoever is yelling the loudest. This is not how it should be.
- Workers prioritizing work based on personal incentives (taken out to lunch)
- Understanding the flow of work is the key to achieving The First Way (how to create a fast flow of work)
- Every work center is made up of 4 things (the 4 Ms):

1. The Machine
2. The Man
3. The Method
4. The Measures

- Properly elevating preventative work is at the heart of programs like Total Productive Maintenance (been embraced by the LEAN community)
- The Third Way is all about ensuring that we're continually putting tension on the system, continually reinforcing habits, and improving something
- Resilience Engineering tells us we should routinely inject faults into the system, doing them frequently, to make them less painful (Improvement Kata)
- ^^^ Ask Patrick and Dave about this point.... Not really clear what that means for us from a monitoring perspective
- Critical part of The Second Way is making wait times visible. Knowing when your work is spending days (months in Optum's case) in someone else's queue because there are not enough resources or because some tasks take too long
- Does a project help with scalability, availability, sustainability, security, supportability, or the defensibility of the organization?

## Chapter 21: Friday, September 26

- You win when you protect the organization without putting meaningless work into the IT system. You win even more when you can take meaningless work out of the IT system.

## Chapter 22: Monday, September 29

- Most important projects increases capacity at constraints

## Chapter 27: Tuesday, October 21

- IT was out of scope for the audits. New security processes to be put in place.

## Chapter 28: Monday, October 27

- Phoenix Deployment 2 goes much smoother, but there are still a lot of bumps. Biggest was caused by a change Brent made by an out of scope Sarah project.

## Chapter 29: Monday, November 3rd

- Flow of work should ideally go in one direction only. Forward.
- First discussions of an agile release cycle (done with SWAT team)

**Part 3**

## Chapter 30: Monday, November 3rd

- take time - the cycle time needed in order to keep up with customer demand
- single-minute exchange of die - Toyota solved issue of not keeping up with customer demand by reducing die changeover time from days to minutes.
- Until something is in production, it adds no value... It is just WIP stuck in the system
- treat infrastructure as code (What does that mean, exactly? How do we treat code at Optum?)
- deployment pipeline
- version control
- automate environment creation process
- CONTINUAL EXPERIMENTATION

## Chapter 31: Monday, November 3

- Understanding what technology can and can't do has become a core competency that every part of business must have.
- Bill to be the next COO of Parts Unlimited
