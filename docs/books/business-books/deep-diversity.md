## 1 - The Four Pillars of Deep Diversity

### He Who Hesitates

As humans, we all have biases we are not aware of that play out on a daily basis.  
According to Mahzarin Banaji, one of the greatest minds behind [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html), our implicit biases exist not on a conscious thinking level, but entirely on the unconscious, emotional plane.

### Not Till You Drink Like Us

We have greater compassion - more care and concern for others - for those who are like ourselves.  
Belonging to groups is not only a key driver of human behavior but also helps form our sense of self - who we are.

### Beyond the Third Dimension: Power

The final insight offered by the Deep Diversity framework is power. Even in egalitarian, democratic societies, power needs to be named, challenged, and equalized to create greater fairness between racial groups.  

### The Deep Diversity Model

Neuroplasticity - Changing habits of the mind.  
Deep Diversity focuses on habit breaking and forming. It is possible to change our habits.  
There are ways to change how we think and perceive, thereby developing new neural patterns.  

Compassion - the mental state of wishing others may be free from suffering. Compassion is needed because diversity is about our differences.  

Diversity and fairness are about all of us as humans. There is no "them."  

## 2 - Emotions: Understanding Ourselves and Others

### Developing Emotional Literacy

Feelings are the roots of our actions, whether we are aware of them or not. A significant portion of our decision making lies below the surface of our awareness. That is why developing emotional literacy is critical.  

Three ideas that are helpful for understanding the unconscious and automatic nature of emotions as they are relevant to issues of racial difference:  

- Tilting towards/away
- Emotional contagion
- Emotional triggers

Negative tilt is stronger than positive tilt.  We have what is known as a negativity bias that primes us for avoidance and remembering the bad even when it's outnumbered by the good.  

### Emotional Contagion: Being Controlled by the Moods of Others

Emotions surround all human dynamics, influencing our interactions on conscious and unconscious levels.  
Those who are emotionally dominant can transfer their mood to others without effort, prior history, or words being spoken.  

Social and physical pain areas overlap in the same region of the brain.  
Emotional intelligence research has clearly shown that when individuals or groups feel positive and upbeat, everything goes better, including creativity, problem solving, productivity, understanding complexity, and predisposition to being helpful.  

According to emotional intelligence research, leaders play a role in how people feel. In a group, they serve as emotional guides. Leaders words and reactions carry more weight than those of other group members; they are watched more carefully and are given more eye contact. We take many of our cues from those in charge.  

### Emotional Triggers: The Role of the Amygdala and Limbic System

To understand emotions and their origins, we need to back up a bit and revisit the brain. It's believed our brains evolved in stages, resulting in three distinct sections known as the reptilian, limbic, and neocortex.  
The reptilian brain is the oldest and most primitive part of us. It regulates our automatic functions such as breathing, heart rate, startle function, swallowing, and a host of other tasks that are essential to basic survival.  
The limbic brain is responsible for the "share and care" parts of our personality. It is critical for nurturing and defending our young, communicating vocally, play, community, empathy, and socialization.  
The neocortex is the metaphorical home of our conscious mind. Thinking, attention, abstract reasoning, fine motor skills, and language are rooted here.  

### It's Hard to Talk about Diversity

Talking about our differences is challenging, especially in public.  

### Mindfulness Meditation

Self compassion helps us observe ourselves with curiosity rather than with judgement.  

## 3 - Bias: Prejudice without Awareness

### Implicit Bias: Prejudice Below the Radar

We hold beliefs about social groups at both visible and invisible levels of awareness. We commonly refer to these beliefs as stereotypes - generalizations about a group of people that can be based on a kernel of truth, an exaggerated reality, or even be an outright lie, resulting in the consciousness or unconsciousness categorization of each member of that group without regard for individual differences.  

### Bias Helps: It's a Necessary Brain Function

The stronger the association is between two ideas, the more well worn the neural path in the brain. In neuroscience terms, this is known as Hebb's Law: "neurons that fire together, wire together." The more repeatedly we think, feel, or do the same thing, the more ingrained the neural path becomes. This, in essence is called a **habit**.

### Beyond the Lab: The Real-World Effect of Bias

A 2002 study called "Unequal Treatment" by the Institute of Medicine in Washington, DC, found significant evidence that discrimination played a role in the differential treatment of racial minority and Aboriginal patients compared to white patients - ranging from physical exams and history taking to referrals for advanced treatment required for diseases like cancer.  

Stereotypes, although sometimes beneficial, do more harm than good. They limit human potential.  

### Bias: Nature or Nurture

We are born with the bias hardware, while society provides us with the software.  
Although we may be born prejudice-free, we learn bias at a very early stage.  

#### Us/Them Rooted in Brain Structures

Research of electrical activity in the brain has shown we have different responses to those whom we perceive as racially "us" and "them."  

### Bias Reduction Strategies

Counter-stereotypes - when encountering those in the "them" category, associate them with a positive word, like "safe." Research has shown this reduces prejudice over time.  

Seven strategies to minimize prejudices:  

1. Role Models
1. Inner Motivation
1. Noticing Personal Contradictions
1. Intergroup contact and friendships
1. Counter-stereotype Plans
1. Carrots and Curiosity
1. Education and Training

### Inner Skill 3: Self-Regulation

Self-regulation is the capacity to keep disruptive emotions and impulses under control, especially under stress.  

## 4 - Tribes: Belonging Drives Human Behavior

### Tribe Are Rooted in the Brain

We have an inherent tendency, called risk intuition, to assess threats in our environment.  
It is theorized that risk intuition was a survival mechanism that allowed early humans to quickly distinguish a tribe member from an outsider - a threat.  

#### Race is Social, Not Biological

Science has shown there are no distinct races based on biological differences and we are, in fact, one human race. The concept of race, referring to different human groups with supposedly distinct physical characteristics, has been created by people.  

### Tribes are Created by Culture

We frequently experience a tension between our need to belong and our desire to be seen as unique.  
Belonging to social groups is an important part of our self-concept. Values and emotions are associated with such membership.  

### In-groups and Out-groups

In-groups: Those Like Us  
We share the same references as to what is "normal" in communications and interactions. We unconsciously understand the unstated rules of the game. We are more willing to make sacrifices for our in-group and we do not always require equitable return from them.  

There is a natural tendency to feel good about our in-groups, creating a positive sense of identity.  

Out-groups: Those Not Like Us  
We may feel uncomfortable in an out-group's presence.  
Everything is more work when engaging with out-group members.  

### Inner Skill 4: Empathy

Categorizing is normal human behavior.  

The Us/Them tendency that is influenced by both genes and culture. Empathy is a good start to reducing the Us/Them tendencies we have.  
Empathy is the ability to tune in to the emotions of others, perceive their feelings, needs, perspectives, and concerns.  

Someone breaking a social norm can be a very emotional experience.  

Curiosity can help foster understanding - both in ourselves and others - and empathy can lead to a deeper acceptance of differences, especially when interacting with out out-group members.  

## 5 - Power: The Dividing Force

### Marco's Rebellion

Privilege - unearned advantage or status based on identity  
Marginalization - disadvantage, or low status based on identity  

Regardless of who we are - our identities - it's difficult to recognize privilege.  
We don't feel our privilege when we have it, even though it may appear obvious from an external perspective.  

When we are in a privileged group, we are focused on our own hard work and challenges. This makes it difficult to see how the system functions to reward our efforts while holding back those of others based on such flimsy factors as social identity.  

We are always conscious to create integrated groups.  

Power - the distribution of socio-economic and political power - is what entrenches differences between groups, amplifying feelings of "us" and "them."

### Systemic Discrimination

Social hierarchies exist in all nations, creating inequality and serving as the source of most forms of intergroup conflict.  
Regardless of where we live, privilege and marginalization seem to be an integral part of the human experience.  
Sidanius and Pratto's framework, called [social dominance theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dominance_theory), states that a dominant group exist in each society.  

### Psychological Distortions

Internalized racism - the incorrect belief that our group (its norms, culture, and people) is inferior.  
Internalized dominance - the incorrect belief, conscious or unconscious, by dominant group members that their group's values, norms, culture, and people are superior.  

### Self-Destructive Behaviors

Self-sabotage - the use of unhelpful thoughts and actions to cope with difficult feelings and existing problems.  

The longer we experience marginalization, the more psychologically vulnerable we become to negative beliefs about what we are capable of.  
Negative psychological impact on non-dominant groups is one more factor bolstering the hierarchical power position of dominant groups.  

### Inner Skill 5: Self-Education

The inner skill to complement an analysis of power, privilege, and marginalization is self-education. Personal effort is required to understand that whether we like it or not, or are aware of it or not, the tribes we belong to matter, especially those based on race and ethnicity.  

Self-education may take a variety of forms, including the following:  

- Self-study
- Learning through relationship
- Formal study

## 6 - Power Part 2: This Time It's Personal

### Limitations of a Power Analysis

The ways we think about things - the lens we use - becomes neurologically wired and formed into habits. When we use the same lens regularly, we lose choice in how we view the world.  

### Personal and Social Power: A Balanced Approach

The oddity about privilege is that it is usually invisible when we have it. It doesn't make us *feel* powerful.  

Personal power is needed to recognize that changing social norms is a slow but continuous process, usually beyond the scope of a single lifetime.  

### Inner Skills 6 & 7: Relationship Management and Conflict Skills

To be vulnerable is an act of personal power. To listen to another person's perspective and let it affect you is an act of personal power. To speak honestly and truthfully, which means standing up for yourself and your side in a conversation, is also an act of personal power.  

### Questions for Cultivating Relational and Conflict Skills

Relational skills are significant markers of personal power. To transform conflict we need to step beyond our perspective, and at times consider the issue from outside of our social identity.  

Meaning making is the inner skill that can help us move forward when nothing else can.  

## 7 - Deep Diversity: Bringing It All Together

### Inner Skill 8: Making Meaning

Racism is a part of our human experience. To change it, we have to accept its reality and understand it.  

We know preferences for our in-groups have been neurologically hard-wired into our species - Homo sapiens - from the start (about 200,000 years ago).  

### A Dominant Group Member's Journey

Important things to remember for dominant group members:  

- Self-awareness
- Self-regulation
- Self-education
- Empathy and relationship building
- Meaning making

### A Non-Dominant Group Member's Journey

It is important for Non-dominant group members to remember:

- Self-awareness
- Self-regulation
- Self-education
- Empathy and relationship building
- Meaning making

### Learning New Implicit Habits

The Platinum Rule - Treat others the way they want to be treated. (Rather than the golden rule, which is, treat others the way you want to be treated).  

Make choices to become conscious of things that most people take for granted.  
This is an important detail in understanding what the deep diversity framework is all about. Changing habits to nurture inclusion, diversity, and equity. We need to become aware of unconscious behavior patterns and more aware of circumstances where such default tendencies do not serve our relationship with others, especially those we perceive to be different than ourselves.  

### Skills Development

Here are some suggestions for becoming more conscious in our interactions with others to maximize the possibility of inclusive and fair interactions.  

- Bias - accept the fact that all of us have implicit biases.  
- Tribes - notice the social entities and groups in our context, from those that have the greatest rank and power to those that have the least.  
- Power - notice how rank and power dynamics manifest in our personal, professional, and community lives.  
- Emotions - develop deeper levels of self-awareness - what we're individually feeling on a moment-to-moment basis.
