Javascript Syntax is the set of rules how JavaScript programs are constructed.

## Javascript Values

The javascript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values. Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.

## Javascript Literals

The most important rules for writing fixed values are: Numbers are written with or without decimals. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes.

## Javascript Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. Javascript uses the keyword var to declare variables.

## Javascript Operators

Placeholder for operators

## Semicolons

Semicolons separate Javascript statements. Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement. When separated by semicolons, multiple statements are allowed on a single line, although that is not encouraged from a readability or best practice standpoint.

## Whitespace

Javascript ignores multiple spaces. Whitespace can be added to make your script more readable.

* A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / )

## Line Length and Line Breaks

Placeholder for line length and breaks content.

## Javascript Placement

In HTML, Javascript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags. Old Javascript may use a type attribute: `<script type = "text/javascript">`. The type attribute is not required.
