title: Kibana Overview
---

Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. Use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices.  

The Elastic vendor recommends Kibana and Elasticsearch be installed on the same server, but it is not required.  

 If Elasticsearch and Kibana are installed on different servers, change the URL (IP:PORT) of the Elasticsearch server in the Kibana configuration file, kibana.yml, before starting Kibana.
