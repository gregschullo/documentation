# Talent and Hiring

Potential Talent - Good fit with behaviors and habits but no experience.

There is risk with potential talent. They may not be able to do the job. Don't have a year long commitment, give potential talent a rookie contract.  
Potential talent is also the least expensive.

Emerging Talent - Doing the job currently and is a good fit.

Proven Talent - Good fit and have done the job. Do exactly what you want them to do.

Two to one ratio. Does the organization get value of two to one with a resource? You can't lose with double value. Don't focus on price, focus on value.  

Motivation equates to effort.

If you have ability to hire from within, you should always do it.

You want to hire people who are motivated to take your job.
