Rules of Healthcare Today:

1. More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.  
1. A lifetime of treatment is preferable to a cure.  
1. Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.  
1. As technologies age, prices can rise rather than fall.  
1. There is no free choice. Patients are stuck and they are stuck buying American.  
1. More competitors vying for business doesn't mean better prices; it can drive prices up, not down.  
1. Economies of scale don't translate to lower prices. With their marketing power, big providers can simply demand more.  
1. There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest prices of all.  
1. There are no standards for billing. There's money to be made in billing for anything and everything.  
1. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.  

These rules will be seen many times throughout this book.

## Introduction - Complaint: Unaffordable Healthcare

The American medical system has stopped focusing on health and science. Instead it attends more or less on profits.  

The healthcare system is in disarray.

A common hospital experience includes dozens of doctors sending separate bills that are often undecipherable. The bills are large and and insurance pays a fraction.  
Imagine if you paid for an airplane ticket and then got separate, inscrutable bills from the airline. Separate bills from the airline, the pilot, the copilot, and the flight attendants. That's how the healthcare market works.  
In no other industry do prices for a product vary by a factor depending on where it is purchased, as is the case for bills for echocardiograms, MRI scans, and blood tests to gauge thyroid functions, to vitamin D levels.  
The price of a Prius at a dealership in Princeton, New Jersey isn't five times higher than what you would pay for a Prius in Hackensack or twice the price of a Prius in New Mexico. The price of that car at the very same dealer doesn't depend on your employer, if your self-employed, or unemployed. Why is that the case for healthcare?

The United States spends nearly one-fifth of its gross domestic product on healthcare, more than $3 trillion per year.

H&P - History and Physical - an organized and disciplined form of record keeping that every doctor uses. The H&P is a remarkable template for understanding complex problems, such as sorting out a patient's multitude of symptoms in order to diagnose properly and to allow for effective treatment. The H&P has predictable components:

- Chief complaint - What major symptoms does the patient notice?
- History of the present illness and review of symptoms - How did the problem evolve?
- Diagnosis and treatment - What is the underlying cause? What can be done to resolve the patient's illness or symptoms?

The chief complaint is typically huge, expensive medical care that doesn't reliably deliver quality results.

The economist Adam Smith spoke of an "invisible hand" with respect to income distribution. In American healthcare, there's a different type of invisible hand at work: it's on the till.

## Chapter 1 - The Age of Insurance

Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.  

Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.

### The History: In the Beginning

The earliest health policies were designed to compensate for income lost while workers were ill. The original purpose of health insurance was to mitigate financial disasters brought about by serious illness  

The first health care insurance model was called Blue Cross Plans. The goal was not to make profit, but to protect patient savings and keep hospitals afloat  

Once acceptance of health insurance was widespread, a domino effect ensued: hospitals adapted to its financial incentives, which changed how doctors practiced medicine, which revolutionized the types of drugs and devices that manufacturers made and marketed. The money chase was on: no one was protecting the patients.  

## Chapter 2 - The Age of Hospitals

The cost of hospital services has grown faster than costs in other parts of our healthcare system. From 1997 to 2012, cost of hospital services grew 149% and physician service costs grew 55%.

Market economists refer to hospitals as "sharks" or "spending machines." With few market forces to curb their behavior, they raise prices as much as they can. Because most hospitals are non-profits, they have no shareholders to answer to and cannot legally show a profit... so they spend money on executive compensation and building fancy gardens and lobbies.

There are armies of consultants whose job it is to improve revenue, compensation, and get their slice of the pie. 10% to 15% of revenue goes to billing and collection companies and contractors do things like claims and preapprovals... Those jobs don't even exist in Europe.

There is so much surplus capacity, which should result in lower costs, but it doesn't... We get the opposite. It's a market failure but it follows certain logic. It's not a healthcare system. It's an industry. At every point there is a way to make money.

### A Doctor's View: One Hospital's Journey from Charity to Profit

Healthcare has become a great way for the Catholic Church, in particular, to collect money. Eight of the ten largest nonprofit hospital systems in the United States have religious affiliations and names.

In 1960, Dr. Albert Starr, a Portland heart surgeon, revolutionized the treatment of heart disease by coinventing and then implanting the first successful artificial heart valve. Millions of patients who would otherwise be dead have benefited from that discovery. Dr. Starr was a medical rock star, a hero, a genuine draw. Yet he was never on a billboard... Marketing and advertising were considered unethical and looked down on. It just wasn't done at that time.

In the 1960s, Medicare arrived to cover hospital payments. Between  1968 and 1980 the number of Americans under 65 covered by good, private insurance was at its peak (about 80%, compared to about 67% in 2007). **Because patients were no longer forking out cash or writing checks for their care, hospitals began charging more for their services.** The original Blues plan at Baylor had paid by the week for hospitalization, but now hospitals like Providence charged for each service at each encounter. In a world populated by doctors, nurses, and nuns, **no one really knew how to figure out how much it cost the hospital to remove an appendix, for example.** There was no harm in aiming high though, because insurers usually paid whatever was requested.

More money began coming in to hospitals, so there was a need to hire more business people to manage it. In the early 1980s, the increasingly powerful hospital administrators held degrees in business or healthcare administration and they paid more attention to the bottom line than to the tradition of medicine.

By the late 1990s, Providence hospital no longer wanted pay an ER or clinic doctors a salary. They treated them as independent contractors. That turned doctors into a business. They negotiated contracts that stipulated what percent of revenues that were deserved.

Economies of scale don't translate to lower prices. With their market power, big providers can simply demand more.

### Behind the Scenes: How Hospitals Got New Business Models

The financial structure of a hospital, due to legal and philosophical constraints, has not developed in the same manners as that of commercial corporations. Hospitals are big businesses. Benefactors alone cannot subsidize hospital operations.

There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest prices of all.

Hospitals' administrators, controllers, and finance committees need accurate cost findings. Similar to executives of supermarkets or department store chains.

According to a 2011 article in the newspaper published by the American Medical Association, more business experience was needed to be a hospital executive. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) remains a common leadership position, but hospitals are creating positions such as chiefs of physical relations, integration, and medical informatics.

### Enter the Consultants

To ensure the U.S. healthcare system would grow in a cost-effective way, Congress passed a law in 1974 requiring state health-planning agencies to grant approval before hospitals could build new facilities or purchase expensive technology. Agencies granted "certificates of need" indicating the community would benefit from the investment. The goal was to avoid duplication of services and overbuilding. That law was rescinded in 1987, resulting in hospitals building whatever they wanted, so long as their revenues supported it. Medical purchases became investments and the medical arms race between hospitals was on.

In 2005, Deloitte hired Tommy Thompson (who had previously been secretary of health and human services) as chairman of its global healthcare practice, thereby lending a big name to its outreach in the new sector. Restructuring a hospital as if it were a steel mill or chicken processing plant seemed uncouth to some boards; but second-tier and financially struggling hospitals opened their doors to consultants.

Hospital reimbursement is a strategic puzzle. All hospitals have a master price list and adjusting it to maximize income was the focus of Deloitte's strategy. To squeeze more money from the purse, Deloitte advised hospitals to stop billing for items such as gauze rolls, which insurers rarely reimbursed, and to boost charges for services like OR time, oxygen therapy, and prescription drugs. The strategy was all about optimizing payments by raising prices on certain items to cover the cost of other items. While it's legal, it's ethically dubious and not good for patients. It certainly increases the cost of healthcare.

For the business departments of hospitals and doctors on staff, the discovery was transformational. The billed price of an item could be completely decoupled from its actual cost. Items that had previously been included in the charge for the operating room or a hospital day could be billed separately.

Just about every hospital employs strategic billing, which is enabled and supported by consultants and healthcare advisory firms. Deloitte is ranked number one by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting - life sciences, payer, provider, and government health. In 2014 it announced record revenues of 34.2 billion dollars, fueled by more than 17% growth in the sector.

### Strategic Billing 101: Upcoding and Facility Fees Lead to a $3,400 Needle Stick

Upcoding: Doctors were charging things as simple as blood draws as level 5 on a 1 - 5 scale. "Things that were written down and what was actually done bore little resemblance," recalls Dr. Richards. Coding creep (upcoding) grew bolder - until it made no sense at all. If needle sticks and eye infections are coded as level 5, what was a crushed chest from a car accident or a heart attack?

Dr. Donald Berwick, a former Medicare administrator, told the CPI that he believed most doctors were not breaking the law, just "learning how to play the game."

Around 2000, a hospital decided it would no longer pay physicians a fixed salary; instead, they would be compensated in proportion to the relative value units (RVUs) of the care they dispensed. RVUs are a measure of productivity used to determine medical billing.

Facility fees also played a role in the rising cost of healthcare. Facility fees were a logical outgrowth of a period of rapid scientific progress in medicine, which allowed many treatments to move to an outpatient setting (a good thing, right?). Improvements in anesthesia, pain medicine, minimally invasive surgery, and biopsy techniques meant that many procedures and operations could be safely performed without an overnight stay. Because hospitals had traditionally charged a day rate for inpatients, it made sense that insurers (including Medicare) had largely accepted their new practice of charging facility fees for major outpatient care.

Facility fees are a unique construct of American healthcare and its business model. Hospitals in Europe don't have them. Nor do other types of businesses in the United States. As Yevgeniy Feyman observed in *Health Affairs Blog,* "When you buy anything - a watch, a car, even groceries - you pay a single price for the goods. The Walgreens down the street doesn't add a separate charge to cover its rent, utilities, or the cost of refrigeration units."

### Closing Departments: Make Money or Die

The new hospital consultants were experts not just in raising revenues with strategic pricing but also in corporate restructuring. Hospitals traditionally had departments that perennially lost money: emergency rooms, labor and delivery, dialysis centers, drug and treatment programs, and outpatient clinics in poorer neighborhoods that served Medicaid populations. These were part of their mission and a moral obligation (importantly, they also received federal funding to subsidize them). But by the early 2000s, every department had to carry its own weight.

As obesity rates climbed, medical equipment companies devised new operations using new products to help combat the condition, and bariatric surgery was a boom field. Companies, hospitals, and doctors' groups lobbied successfully to have insurers pay for it all. Being overweight was rebranded a disease.

New machines were purchased based not on medical necessity or even utility but according to financial calculation.

Rule 1: More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.

### The Business of Medical Training: Hospitals and Cheap Labor

By 2014 hospitals received about $15 billion a year in government subsidies to support graduate medical education, a number that had been "increasing for decades." These payments include "direct payments" to compensate for the theoretical inefficiencies and institutional sacrifice involved in training new doctors, such as longer hospital stays and the need to order more tests for teaching purposes.  
Studies have not provided proof of those purported inefficiencies and sacrifices that merited special compensation. Stays in teaching hospitals are no longer than those without residents, for example.  
In fact, there is much to suggest that hospitals have turned residencies into another profitable business.  
They are learning but are also effectively low-wage labor.  
The median cost to a hospital for each full-time resident in 2013 was $134,803. That includes a salary of between $50,000 and $80,000. Federal support translates into about $100,000 per resident per year. Researchers have calculated that the value of the work each resident performs annually is $232,726.

### The Emergence of Hospital-Hotels

"There are an infinite number of ways to spend: amenities, scanners, salaries, building more.

Medicare pays hospitals a bonus for performing well on patient surveys, "so if a patients asks for a test and it won't hurt, they'll get it. It's good for Press Ganey scores. It takes more time and trouble to explain to a patient why they don't need an X-ray, for example."

### The Most Profitable Nonprofits: The Evolution of Hospital Charity

Not-for-profit hospitals are now just as profitable as capitalist corporations, but the excess money flowing in isn't called "profit" - it's "operating surplus."

The *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* has uncovered many of the relevant numbers on UPMC: it is "Allegheny County's largest property owner, with 656 acres," 86% of which is tax exempt. If it were not classified as a nonprofit, "UPMC would owe the city $20 million more in taxes every year."

### Observation Status: A New Financial Purgatory in the Hospital

The idea of admitting a patient for "observation" has long been an important medical tool but was likely far more useful a few decades ago.  
As observation has become less important for diagnosis, it has become more important for lucrative billing construct, manipulated by hospitals, insurers, and nursing homes.

Medicare penalizes hospitals if patients bounce back thirty days after discharge - the "readmission penalty." But if they were never officially admitted and were merely under "observation" they couldn't bounce back.

For hospitals and insurers, observation status has benefit. For patients it is a disaster.

In 2015 President Obama signed a bill requiring hospitals to notify patients receiving more than twenty-four hours of observation care of their status as outpatients and its varied implications. But that notification comes after the fact, when patients are already supine in their hospital bed and can do little about it.

## Chapter 3 - The Age of Physicians

Surgeon pledge in 1990: "I will set my fees commensurate with the services rendered. I will take no part in any arrangement such as fee splitting or itinerant surgery.

In 1990 the American College of Surgeons felt it was immoral to be an itinerant surgeon. The current surgeon pledge, adopted in 2004, had been amended to remove the ethical limitations.

Surgeons are not the only group of doctors watering down their moral commitments. The American Medical Association's code of ethics has similarly been diluted.

### What is a Doctor's Work Worth?

Being a doctor is deserving of reasonable compensation, but what is seen as reasonable has escalated to unusual heights. Doctors make more in the US than in other countries and the gap is high in specialties.

- Primary care doctors make about 40% more in the US than their German counterparts.
- US orthopedic surgeons make more than twice as much as similar German specialists.

As the number of salaries of hospital administrators has risen, doctors have wanted a cut of the profits.

### The Price of a Cure: A Brief History of Doctors' Finances

More competitors vying for business doesn't mean better prices; it can drive prices up, not down.

According to the Medical Group Management Association, median physician income for all primary care doctors increased 9.9% from 2000 - 2004, compared with 15.8% increase for all non-primary care specialists. Median income for hematologists and oncologists increased 35.6% to $350,000 and median income for diagnostic radiologists increased 36.2% to $407,000. Average real income for all Americans dropped 3% during that time.

### Doctors Get the Key to the Vault

With the new system, constant updates were needed to determine fair value and payment. Medicare assigned that task to the American Medical Association (AMA). Allowing the AMA to determine doctors' payments is similar to letting the American Petroleum Institute decide what BP, Shell, and Exxon Mobile can charge us not just for gas, but for wind and solar power as well. The AMA says the RUC represents the entire medical profession, but it is not really representative of practicing doctors.

Researchers have determined the all-important "time" component assigned to procedures is often wildly inaccurate. Better surgical approaches, computerized equipment, and more effective anesthesia means surgical times have often declined dramatically since the RBRVS was first used in 1992. The RUC determines the time it takes to perform a service by polling several dozen specialists who do the procedure, which is essentially asking them if they want to be paid more or not...

### Strategy #1: Doctor-Entrepreneur-Owner

Ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) became increasingly popular over the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s. More were owned and run by individual doctors and investors.

Doctors saw new income potential, because they could charge facility fees; room rentals for the suites where they applied their trade.

Neurologists opened sleep centers where patients could have their brain activity measured and breathing monitored for sleep apnea. Insurance was often billed from $5,000 to $10,000 a night. Regulators tried in vain to curb the practice by requiring physicians to disclose to patients in advance... But these disclosures usually came in a pile of paperwork to sign.

Minor interventions doctors had once performed in the office were moved into their centers for financial benefit.

### Strategy #2: The Hidden Doctors and Their Mysterious Bills

There are physicians who contribute to your care whom you may never see: pathologists, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and emergency medicine docs. The first three are often referred to as the NPC ("no patient contact:) specialists.  
Historically, these physicians were hospital employees and their services were embedded in hospital charges just like bandages and beds. They were paid decent salaries but no more. It's surprising today they account for some of the highest, most confusing doctors' bills you're likely to get.

By 2014, 65% of the nation's five thousand hospitals had contracted out their emergency department staffing/management function. For those in the industry, it was a win-win situation. Hospitals no longer had to buy malpractice or health insurance or figure out how to staff vacations. Doctors could charge what they thought they were worth. But for patients, this meant the proliferation of separate bills for these doctors' services, from companies with mysterious return addresses in distant states.

The game with PARE specialists is they began to refuse to contract with any plan or insurer. "These guys decide not to contract, so they can charge whatever they want. The patient is over the barrel."

### Strategy #3: The Pacts Doctors Make

In 1964 a statute called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was designed to force hospitals to remember their long standing obligations in an era of more commercialized healthcare. All patients who turned up at the emergency room had to be treated, regardless of their ability to pay. Hospitals couldn't turn away sick patients or pregnant women who were poor. But EMTALA doesn't apply to physicians, who are free to pick and choose which patients to accept.

### Strategy #4: One Doctor for the Price of Two

Over the last 20 years many doctors have managed the feat of having two of themselves, at least for billing purposes. They do it with physician extenders. Physician extender is an umbrella term that refers to the trained ancillary personnel who help doctors and surgeons care for patients, including nurse practitioners, surgical technicians, physician assistants, and midwives.

Extending has also become a useful billing construct, enabling doctors to bill for work done by the extenders who work for and with them, as if the doctors themselves were personally dispensing the care. Slowly but surely, the idea that extenders' work constituted as "billable hours" became commonplace.

The doctor never saw the patient, never had any interaction with the patient, and yet a service can be billed under that physician? Under many private payers, it is not fraud.

### Strategy #5: Selling Stuff - Buy and Bill

More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.

Whistle blower lawsuits filed against makers of drugs and devices, alleging bribes and kickbacks to induce doctors to use and overuse high priced products, have become a staple of legal dockets

Oncologists prospered buying chemotherapy drugs from manufacturers and infusing them in the office, generally with a hefty markup, a practice known as "buy and bill." As the wholesale price of new drugs jumped again and again, doctors had little motivation to complain because they were allowed a markup that was often a set percentage of cost. Doctors who used more expensive drugs earned far more. The practice of buy and bill increased dramatically in the late 1990s and into the new century.

As technologies age, prices can rise rather than fall.

There is no free choice. Patients are stuck and they are stuck buying American.

### Strategy #6: Upgrades

Medical progress had proved great for patients but not for ophthalmologists' incomes. Doctors have done their best to fix that shortfall.

After discovering that ophthalmologic practices were advertising laser cataract surgery, Medicare issued a "guidance." Making an incision - whether by scalpel or laser - was considered part of the surgery fee and could not be billed separately. If patients really wanted "laser" surgery they would - once again - have to pay for it themselves.

Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.

### Strategy #7: Adopt a Surgical Procedure - Money, Money Everywhere

Thousands of physicians made more than $1,000,000 each from Medicare in 2012 and dozens more than $10,000,000.

Medicine is a business. It won't police itself. People have lost faith in the American medical profession - that they would act differently than other businesses - but they were wrong.

## Chapter 4 - The Age of Pharmaceuticals

More competitors vying for business doesn't mean better prices; it can drive prices up, not down.

As technologies age, prices can rise rather that fall.

Nearly all American manufacturers of mesalamine products figured out ways to move their tax base overseas, using a controversial practice called an inversion that many legal experts regard as tax evasion.

### The Modest History of Making Medicines

Brand makers ability to claim extended patent protection, coupled with generics competitors' constant challenges to weak patents, meant that the amendment instead ushered in an era in which multimillion dollar court battles over patents now precede (and delay) each generic entry, driving prices up in the process.

A strong patent system and no pricing restriction led to a profound shift of pharmaceutical investment into the United States and away from Europe, where government price setting was increasingly common. By 2002 global drugmakers were spending 82 percent of their money in the United States. The US pharmaceutical industry has grown twice as fast as the economy at large since 1990.

There is no free choice. Patients are stuck. And they're stuck buying American.

### New Policies Transform an Industry

For much of medical history and into the 1980s, drugs were cheap. Vaccines cost pennies and antibiotics and epinephrine shots were a few dollars. Even the most exotic medicines couldn't list for more than a few hundred dollars a dose. The emergence of successful drug therapy in response of the crisis of HIV/AIDS permanently shifted the long-standing business paradigm of drug approval, pricing, and value.

A lifetime of treatment is preferable to cure.

Drug companies that used interim measures to prove the success of their products often made empty promises to do follow-up studies to makes sure products approved through these proxy targets actually yielded long-term improvement for patients.  
An in-depth data investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and MedPageToday in 2014 revealed that, thanks to surrogate endpoints, 74% of cancer drugs approved by the FDA during the previous decade ultimately did not extend life by even a single day.

Direct-to-consumer drug advertising rose from $166 million in 1993 to $4.2 billion in 2005, and in 2006 it made up nearly 40% of total pharmaceutical promotional spending. In 2000 Merck spent more advertising its new painkiller, Vioxx ($160 million), than Budweiser ($146 million), Pepsi ($126 million), or Nike ($78 million).  
In 2004 Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market. The company ultimately paid a criminal fine of $950 million for its marketing and sales tactics.

Drug advertising is now a constant in our lives. The Supreme Court has protected drug advertising under the guise of free speech. The US one of two countries that allow it, along with New Zealand.

### Non-24; or, it Pays to Advertise

Vanda, a boutique drugmaker based in Washington, DC, had developed a new molecule, called tasimelteon, which resembled melatonin and attached to a melatonin receptor, producing a similar effect.

Dr. Sack was an expert on the panel that had unanimously recommended the approval a few months before. He explained he came out to thinking our system of drug approval doesn't make any sense. Because of the FDA's criterion we were following to determine efficacy, he was forced to vote yes, but it made him uncomfortable as the drug was not demonstrably better than melatonin.  
FDA panels don't consider the cost of products they review. Vanada's Hetlioz was priced at $96,000 ($8,000 a month or $267 per dose)... Now there is a prescription drug that is not as effective as melatonin (which you can buy for $6 for a bottle of over 100 pills).  
It's eye popping that we could get into this situation and that the new drug can be advertised on TV.  
Because melatonin is a product of nature the molecule can't be patented. No company will go through the expensive testing and application process to get melatonin formulated as a prescription drug. It's sold as a nutritional supplement and not regulated or tested with great exactitude. The proper dosing of melatonin has never been studied to FDA standards.... But the chemically created analog tasimelteon can be patented.

TL:DR Vanda and Hetlioz is a scam.

Now that we rely on the profit incentive to motivate drug research, we learn only what the industry deems is profitable for us to find out.

### Patent Plays

Drug manufacturers seized on the opportunity to get new patents for asthma inhalers with new propellants, removing from the market generic inhalers that had long been available. The usual price of the most common inhaled asthma medicine, albuterol, rose from about $10 to over $100. It costs $7 to $9 in Australia, where it's still generic and even sold over the counter.

There are endless ways to extend your product's value through manipulating FDA policies and patent law.

- File a lawsuit
- Modify the delivery
- Play to the FDA's weaknesses and blind spots
- Take it over the counter
- Create a combination

**File a lawsuit** - Getting a patent only costs $20,000 and applications are unlimited. There's strong motivation for drug companies to file weak patents. Brand makers take out weak patents, generics challenge them, and the brand makers answer back with an objection. Under Hatch-Waxman, that objection alone sets off a mandatory thirty-month halt in the FDA's consideration of the generic entrant.

**Modify the delivery** - Product hopping - moving products from one form to another. For example, changing a drug from a pill to a chewable tablet.  
Since generics must be identical in dosage and form to the brand-name drug for a pharmacist to substitute, companies can make moves to succeeded in delaying competition from generics for years.  

**Play to the FDA's weakness and blindspots** - Sprays, lotions, and creams don't have to play legal games to fend off competition from generics since these formulations are hard to replicate according to the FDA's extracting standards. For pills, it's relatively straightforward to show the chemical composition is equivalent to the brand and to measure that it produces the same level of medication in the blood.

**Take it over the counter** - Changing a drug's legal status so it can be sold over the counter is sometimes a profitable patent play for pharmaceutical companies (known as an "OTC switch"), but it can be a risky decision.  Prescriptions are key to charging high prices (because insurers pay) and holding a pharmaceutical monopoly intact. In much of the world, products go over the counter when they are deemed safe enough to take without a doctor's intervention. In the US, it is a business calculation.  
More treatment is always better, default to the most expensive option.  
An OTC switch makes products available to a wider audience of buyers but manufacturers have to lower the price considerable because insurance is no longer involved. They also have to establish brand recognition with consumers.  
According to US law, the same product cannot be on the market as both a prescription and an over-the-counter product.  
FDA grants any company that takes a prescription drug to OTC status three years of market exclusivity for that sales route, during which other manufacturers are forbidden from making store-brand copies.  

**Create a combination** - Patient outrage over the high price of patent plays was the last business barrier drugmakers had to resolve. As pharmaceutical prices increased, insurers imposed co-payments that were a percentage of the bill to encourage the use of cheaper alternatives.

### Desperate Patients and Bribes, or Charity?

More competitors vying for business doesn't mean better prices. It can drive prices up, not down.

Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.

### The Rise of Invisible Robber Barons

A different class of backroom mercenaries entered the medical fray in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Today there are a handful of huge PBMs - Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, OptumRX - and they have enormous sway over your care.

PBMs are for profit companies that make money by pocketing a percentage of the discounts they negotiate. Items that end up on the formularies of covered drugs and devices aren't always the ones patients need most or those that work best, but rather the ones on which the PBM has wrangled the best deal, with the best negotiated profit margin.

### "We Regret to Inform You That the Generic Isn't Available

Shortages of cheaper, affordable essential medicines in hospitals have become the new normal.

### Generic Sticker Shock at the Pharmacy Counter

Over 80% of prescriptions in the US are filled with generics, which is a higher percentage than most developed countries. But some generics are no longer a bargain.

Intense competition among manufacturers of generic drugs in the early twenty-first century had resulted in some rock-bottom prices for consumers. But the smaller profit margins, plus the lure of easier money to be made by producing more lucrative items, drove some of these manufacturers to quit making older cheap drugs, thereby handing near monopolies to those who remained in the market.  

To really bring down prices through market competition, probably four or five generics would need to be on the shelves, and that level of competition was rare. As a result, after 2010 generics often settled into a price point just slightly below the brand-name drug.

### A Myth: At Least We Get Drugs First

America pays double, sometimes triple, what other developed countries spend on drugs but takes comfort in getting new treatments and cures first. That is often true, but not always.

Cost-saving new treatments have had a maddeningly hard time finding their way into the American bazaar, because lower prices for patients often translated into loss of income for someone with greater clout.

## Chapter 5 - The Age of Medical Devices

There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest prices of all.

The medical device sector has quietly matured, devising new financial models and methods that have escaped in-depth scrutiny. The relative insulation makes sense. You likely don't know the name of the catheter that delivered the wire-mesh stent into your heart, or which company made it, and are even less likely to have any idea about its price. Yet these pieces of hardware are frequently the single biggest item on your medical bill, costing many thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars.

Medical devices essentially have no real set price at all.

Each year, more people seem to get involved, and each takes a commission or adds a markup as the device moves along the long road from the factory to your body.

Device manufacturers are a tight-knit oligopoly with nearly absolute control of distribution.  

### The Secret History of Medical Devices and Their Regulation

Today there is generally far less careful scrutiny of new devices than of new drugs, even though mist drugs can be stopped in an instant if problems emerge and many devices are permanently implanted in the body.  

Device companies have become the darlings of venture capital and there has been a proliferation of device patents.

### Joints Are a Big Business (But Don't Expect a Warranty)

Note to patients: precise success/failure percentages given for a procedure should be a red flag.

There is no free choice. Patients are stuck. They are stuck buying American.  

More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.  

In an example of medical device pricing given in the book, an insurer would not cover a device, but the hospital would lease it for $10,000. The doctor quoted $7,000. The patient called the manufacturer, who proposed $5,000. She explained to the manufacturer she could not afford it and she only had $1,778 in her health savings account. Their reply was, "we'll take it!"

The 510(k) program has led to a number of medical disasters.  

There are no standards for billing. There's money to be made in billing for anything and everything.  

The most effective way to make sure that the newest, most expensive products ended up in the highest number of patients was in forming tight, codependent relationships with orthopedic surgeons. "Manufacturers marketed heavily to doctors - "We have this great new thing!"

With the 510(k) programs, device makers could readily reward the surgeons with patents and profits or funding for pet research projects.

In recent years, hospitals have begun fighting back against the medical device industry, suddenly demanding that device reps, like lobbyists, be registered and get permission each time they enter the premises.  

### How to Get into a Patient's Heart? Follow the Money

Like drugmakers, device manufacturers have another big line of business to invest in, one that has nothing to do with serving patients: suing over intellectual property.  

Who really pays for the price of all the legal maneuvering? Patients, of course.

### Dr. Elliot's Lonely Crusades

There is no free choice. Patients are stuck. They are stuck buying American. Doctors are too.  

## Chapter 6 - The Age of Testing and Ancillary Services

In 2014 UnitedHealthcare paid laboratories between $17 and $618 for vitamin D tests, and those done in hospital labs were by far the most costly.  
There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest prices of all.  

American patients desire high-priced exploration and treatment if it means their illness will be fixed on the spot.  

Over the past decade, testing, medical equipment, and ancillary services became to hospitals and clinics what booze is to restaurants: high-profit-margin items that can be billed for nearly any amount. Better still, many insurers require no co-pay for these items once patients have met their deductible, so most patients don't care how much they cost.  

### An Experiment in Billing

Prior to 2007 imaging was the fastest-growing component of healthcare costs all over the nation.  

In Japan, where the price for tests is determined by a panel of doctors, economists, and policy makers, an MRI costs $160 using the most advanced machines; $133 on machines with moderate resolution; $92 for the most primitive version. That allows for a decent profit on a technology that is over a quarter century old. It doesn't include the radiologists $45 fee.  

Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.  

A resident at a medical center in New York noted when his hospital hired a new radiologist, the volume of a sophisticated and extremely profitable test called CT angiography suddenly quadrupled. Everyone noticed this shift and understood the motives... The employees were told to keep their mouths shut about the issue.  

### A Snip and $,1000: How Pathology Evolved into Big Business

Patients typically have no choice over where their tissue fragments get sent and doctors frequently have no idea of the charges.  

### Taken for a Ride: Private Equity Ambulance Care

Ambulance companies occupy an indispensible position in the hospital supply chain and one that proved easy to monetize: they bring in the paying customers.  

By 2011 ambulance transport was no longer primarily a charitable service but such a good business that America's two largest private sector providers, Rural/Metro and American Medical Response, were both bought by private equity firms that year.  
Buoyed by the potential for ambulance revenues, cities and counties also began billing insurance and charging more.  

Richard Dickinson recalls, "The Fire Department's attitude, which the City Council bought, was they could keep raising the ambulance transportation rates because private insurers always paid. For individuals with no insurance, often the City Council would tell them to ignore the bills. After 3 or 4 bills were sent, LAFD would write off the account receivable."

The Fire Department of the City of New York raised its base charges for a ride from $515 to $740, even though Medicare determined it was worth only about $243.57  
Ambulance rides generate more than $200 million for the city each year.  

### No Pain, Big Gains: The Business of Physical Therapy

In 1979 Medicare limited the amount it would pay for outpatient physical therapy to only $100/year. That amount increased to $500 in 1982, $900 in 1994, and $1500 in 1999.

### Preying on the Elderly for Profit

Home evaluation companies like CenseoHealth are a new kind of investor-owned healthcare business that has thrived in the past five years.  

Well insured Americans suffer often from too much treatment - particularly as they age - with tests and services meted out not for health, but for money.  

## Chapter 7 - The Age of Contractors: Billing, Coding, Collections, and New Medical Businesses

There are no standards for billing. There's money to be made in billing for anything and everything.  

There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest price of all.  

Economies of scale don't translate to lower prices. With their marketing power, big providers can simply demand more.  

### A Brief History of Medical Coding

The historical purpose of coding was strictly epidemiologic - to classify and track causes of death and prevent the spread of infections among populations that spoke different languages.  
Medical coding systems originated at about the same time as the bubonic plague.  

Coders who work for hospitals strive to get money. The coders employed by insurers try to deny claims as overreaching. Coders who audit Medicare charts look for abuses that need to be punished.  
Suddenly, coding meant big bucks and a new industry thrived. For-profit colleges began offering medical coding degrees, and required internships soon followed.  

The latest iteration of international disease codes, ICD-10, was completed in 1992 and has been used by the rest of the world for decades.  
Why did it take the United States until 2015 to fully deploy it? The problem was the United States' medical billing system and how to game it was built around ICD-9. Changing to a new system that identified medical conditions more specifically using new numerical codes was good for international epidemiology - but terrible for the business of American medicine.  

### The Verifiers and Certifiers

Wasteful bureaucratic processes have been a lucrative job creator for the business of healthcare. They also siphon hours away from what patients want from their doctor and what good doctors want to provide: human contact.  

## Chapter 8 - The Age of Research and Good Work for Profit: The Perversion of a Noble Enterprise

A lifetime of treatment is preferable to a cure.  

### A New Model: The Changing Vision of Medical Charity

At a booth in the exhibition hall, kids earn beach balls or tattoos for answering a simple question on a white board: "What is your wish for the future of diabetes?" The answers are mostly the same: "A cure." But most of the exhibitors and sponsors who help underwrite the conference are focused on something else: selling ever-costlier treatments and supplies.  

Between 2010 and 2015, the cost of insulin and other products used to manage diabetes skyrocketed, despite a few significant advances in treatment. The recommended wholesale price of different forms of insulin rose between 127 and 325 percent.  

As technologies age, prices can rise rather than fall.  

### The Invention of Venture Philanthropy

Foundations had an enticing new business model: "venture philanthropy"; that is, investing money in drug, device, and biotech companies with the expectation of financial return.  
Venture philanthropy had successfully propelled the innovation, but there was mixed motivation to make sure it was affordable.  

Today, every piece of good work in medicine seems to need a promising business model.  

### A Bible with Ads

Physician's Desk Reference (PDR). The PDR cataloged doses, side effects, half-lives, interactions, chemical structures, and results of clinical trials for all approved medicines.  

Some prescribing programs were touting price transparency, but the information was vague and not "actionable," meaning not specific enough to allow a patient to make a different purchase.  

### Entering the Gilded Age

The AMA's (American Medical Association) primary focus in the past ten to fifteen years has been medical finance - filing lawsuits against insurers over how to calculate "usual, customary, and reasonable" and opposing Medicare's public release of payments to physicians, for example.  

### Turf Battles and Trade Wars: Medical Societies Form Super PACs

The medical industry has become the country's biggest lobbying force, spending nearly half a billion dollars each year. In 2015 the oil and gas industry spent $130 million, securities and investment firms about $100 million, and the defense/aerospace industry a mere $75 million.

The Illinois State Society successfully championed legislation allowing doctors to supervise up to five full-time physicians assistants and bill as if they delivered the care themselves. A doctor in Illinois can now be in six places at once.  

### Who Wrote the Guidelines?

More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.  

Dr. Norton felt as if he had been used: "They say, we fight to protect patients, but what they really mean is we fight to get exorbitant fees for unneeded procedures."  
Dr. Norton's experience highlights a flaw in how we pursue evidence-based medicine. The specialists who make money from procedures create the guidelines for when and how often they should be performed.  

## Chapter 9 - The Age of Conglomerates

There are no standards for billing. There's money to be made in billing for anything and everything.  

Hospitals without competition could more easily get away with rendering only profitable services.  

### The Doctors' Faustian Bargain

Dr. Alexander Lakowsky sold his practice to Sutter. He was forced to place the good of the conglomerate over the good of his patients. There was heavy pressure to refer his patients for testing and training within the Sutter system, which was overpriced. He wasn't able to advocate for his patients well.  

### The Electronic Medical Record as a Business Weapon

The first step under Obama's HITECH Act was to require doctors and hospitals to go electronic with their record keeping. The second step, required a few years later, was termed "meaningful use" - prodding doctors to and hospitals to deploy the new technology for the good of the patient: sending records to other hospitals or doctors with a click of the mouse or allowing patients to review lab results at home without needing to talk to a doctor.  

The government invested heavily in the EMR as a tool to enable good patient care, with the idea that they would allow the sharing of medical records between a sick person's physicians. But competing health systems have little financial incentive to do so. Instead, they have frequently become tools for conglomerates to protect market share or dominate their market.  

In the United States, EMRs have evolved to put business before patients. Disjointed and siloed, they have not delivered on their promise.  

### A Part-Time Emergency Room

Most states that allow freestanding ERs at least insist they stay open 24/7 and take all emergencies regardless of the patient's ability to pay - though they cannot accept Medicare or Medicaid, since government insurers insist that to qualify as an ER and bill ER rates, an emergency room must be physically connected to a hospital.  

### Consolidation: Rebranding Doctors' Offices

Big hospitals hold enormous leverage in setting the terms of insurance contracts, because insurers need them in their networks.  

### Endgame

## Chapter 10 - The Age of Healthcare as Pure Business

Our healthcare system today treats illness and wellness as just another object of commerce: Revenue generation. Supply chain optimization. Minimization of tax liability. Innovative business modeling. Things sold. Services rendered. Bills to be paid.  

Even with cheaper drugs being developed, they were still sold at the same price as to not look inferior to existing drugs.  

More competitors vying for business doesn't mean better prices; it can drive prices up, not down.  

As technologies age, prices can rise rather than fall.  

There were significant and much desired advances in the hemophilia industry - advances that could have and should have come *before patent expiration* induced companies to make the effort.  

## Chapter 11 - The Age of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)

Even the well-intentioned provisions that managed to survive the tortuous congressional negotiations over the ACA have been in practice diluted and perverted, as providers find ways to maximize revenue by gaming its rules.  
Obamacare, as it has come to be called, was supposed to build a first line of defense against the expenses of American medicine. It is, in some respects, revolutionary, a declaration that decent healthcare for every American is a guiding principle and government responsibility. It created some important incentives and rules to nudge the profit-oriented system toward better serving patients.  

In healthcare, entrepreneurship outsmarts regulation every time.  

### Costs Take a U-turn: Lesson of Medicare Drug Coverage

Medicare Part D is prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries enacted in 2006 under Republican President, George W Bush. The government hadn't previously offered assistance to patients 65 and older, but with the cost of medicine increases in the 1990s, reports of seniors not taking their medicine because it was too expensive were going viral.  
Part D had a doughnut hole... If a patient's cost exceeded $2960/year, the patient paid 100% of the cost until they hit the $4,700 mark for their medicines, at which point Medicare paid 95% of the costs after. This was to discourage patients taking more medicines or more expensive medicines than they may need.  
Once seniors were guaranteed drug coverages and were only paying co-payments, drug companies and insurers raised prices and co-pays to discourage using the service.  

### How Politicians Undermine the ACA

The public option refers to the notion that there would be on offer a national health insurance plan or that the government would allow anyone to choose Medicare as his insurer. That was jettisoned after the administration judged it would prevent the ACA's passage because of objections from the insurance industry.  

### How Insurers Undermine the ACA

Most of the plans offered through the ACA are so-called high-deductible plans, and the law has helped spread this type of coverage.  

A 2015 study found when patients were switched to a high-deductible health plan, they didn't become smarter, more cost-conscious shoppers for medical care. The exorbitant prices demanded by the U.S. healthcare system meant they mostly just avoided any interactions with medicine at all.  

### How Hospitals and Doctors Undermine the ACA

The small financial incentives to encourage good behavior and coordinate medical care often paled compared to the profit that could be garnered by creative or aggressive billing that tested the boundaries of the law.  

Fifty percent of colonoscopies involve removing polyp, but if one was removed many doctors said it was no longer a free screening procedure. The Affordable Care Act didn't mean that tests were no longer free if something was found and removed for scrutiny.  

The U.S. healthcare system gradually evolved sector by sector, hospital by hospital, doctor by doctor. What the players are doing is, technically speaking, perfectly legal. Participants in the marketplace respond to the incentives and opportunities a market allows. That's what they're supposed to do. Each component of the system is genuinely convinced that it's not so bad, not responsible for our $3 trillion medical bill. Someone else is more to blame. Drug spending is only 10% of the national health budget. Nursing homes are only responsible for 5% of health costs. Payments to doctors only 20%! Dermatology accounts for only 4% of Medical expenditures. Each segment of our medical system is convinced that its charges are reasonable. But put all the little excess together and you get healthcare that is much worse and much costlier than the sum of its parts. We, the patients, are stuck in the middle, and it seems we've reached critical condition.  

## Chapter 12 - The High Price of Patient Complacency

We have votes, and we have a voice - as patients, we must dare to raise it.  

It is often only after Americans get sick in other countries they understand just how broken their own system is.  

The United States will find its own particular healthcare solution. A wide array of tools is available for reforming and reclaiming our healthcare system for patients, building on the foundation of the ACA or its replacement.  

## Chapter 13 - Doctors' Bills

### Part 1. What You Can Start Doing Now - Doctor Bills

We all need to be more "difficult" patients to share in decision-making and to expect more discussion - and that is absolutely true about costs.  
Every patient can help to ward off unwanted healthcare costs by asking questions about care and its price tag beforehand.  

#### Choosing Your Doctor

When selecting a primary care doctor, there are some basic questions you should ask about the business structure of the practice that will impact your bills.

1. Is the practice owned by a hospital or licensed as a surgery center?  
1. Will you refer me only to other physicians in my insurance network, or explain why in advance if you can't?
1. If I need blood work or radiology testing, can you send me to an in-network lab?  
1. Will there be charges for phone advice or filling out forms? Is there an annual practice fee?  
1. If I'm hospitalized, will you be seeing me in the hospital? What is your coverage on weekends?  

#### In Your Doctor's Office

Here are some questions every doctor or healthcare provider should be able to answer for you at a doctor's appointment.

1. How much will this test/surgery/exam cost?  
1. How will this test/surgery/exam change my treatment?  
1. Which blood test are you ordering? What X-Ray? Why?  
1. Are there cheaper alternatives that are equally good, or nearly so?  
1. Where will this test/surgery/exam be performed - at the hospital, surgery center, or in the office - and how does that place impact the price?  
1. Who else will be involved in my treatment? Will I be getting a separate bill from another provider? Can you recommend someone in my insurance network?  

#### The Value of Waiting Before Seeking Treatment

The healthcare industry spends nearly $15 billion on advertising annually to encourage worry. That's good business, but not smart medicine.  

The value of so-called watchful waiting is taught in medical school, but is terrifically underused in American medicine because it isn't at all profitable. The "do something!" strategy prevails.  
Don't rush to the doctor. Give your body a chance to heal. Start with some advice from a pharmacist (their knowledge is terribly underutilized in our current system).  

### Part 2. System Change: What We Want from Doctors

In training, doctors are generally taught little to nothing about the cost of healthcare. This ignorance has profound implications both for their future practices and for us.  

Prices should be included on order sheets or, at the very least, hospitals should provide medical staff with their master list - the chargemaster - so they can educate themselves about what services the hospital charges and for how much.  

The chain reaction to price transparency begins with patients posing the same simple question: "How much does that cost?"  

#### Malpractice and Medical School Reform

About three quarters of doctors say that worries about malpractice suits at least occasionally influence their practice and encourage excessive test ordering. Reforming the malpractice system will also be good for patients. The most frequent beneficiaries of our current system are lawyers.  

Malpractice reform is atop the wish list of every physician. Here are a few suggestions:  

1. Place limits on noneconomic damages
1. Encourage arbitration
1. Offer warranties and guarantees

If we want the best, most caring doctors to join the battle against cost, we need a fairer way to finance medical education.  
The huge expense of medical school may encourage some students to choose profitable specialties in order to easily pay back loans and deter others from entering fields where pay is relatively low, such as neurology, endocrinology, and family practice.  

1. Price transparency should be mandated
1. Not-for-profit hospitals should be not for profit. Period.  

    - These organizations currently hide large profits in excessive executive compensation, excessive lavish building projects, bloated foundations, and other 'shell games.'

1. Physicians should be prohibited from owning medical facilities of any nature that they could potentially refer patients to. Examples include surgicenters, laboratories, imaging equipment, etc. This is clearly a conflict of interest and should be illegal.  

The best doctors will not be threatened by questioning, skeptical patients. They are too discomfited with the way we deliver medicine and the prices we pay. Their goals are the same as yours.  

## Chapter 14 - Hospital Bills

Note:

### Part 1. What You Can Start Doing Now - Hospital Bills

#### Vet Your Hospital

Scientific studies do not demonstrate a correlation between price and quality of care.  

#### In the Hospital

You can protect your financial health while in the hospital by asking the right questions.  

1. Hospitals have built huge oversupply of private rooms, though insurers frequently won't cover their cost.  
1. In the pages of admitting documents you'll have to sign, there is inevitably one concerning your willingness to accept financial responsibility for charges not covered by your insurer.  
1. Be clear on the terms of your stay in the hospital: Are you being admitted or held under "observation status"? Ask point-blank.  
1. If you're feeling well enough, ask to know the identity of every unfamiliar person who appears at your bedside, what he or she is doing, and who sent him or her.  
1. If the hospital tries to send you home with equipment you don't need, refuse it, even if it's "covered by your insurance."  

#### Dealing with Bills

1. If you receive an outrageous bill from a hospital, a testing center, or a medical office, don't wait - negotiate!  
1. When a hospital bill arrives in the mail, request complete itemization.  
1. Check the bill against the notes you made while you were in the hospital.  
1. Protest bills in writing to create a record.  
1. Argue against surprise out-of-network bills.  

### Part 2. System Change: What We Want from Hospitals and Hospital Regulators

#### Patient-Friendly Price Disclosure

Every hospital has a master price list - the infamous and generally hidden chargemaster - often developed with input from business consultants.  

Chargemasters do not have to be presented in any standard format, making prices nearly impossible to compare from one hospital to the next.  
The California chargemasters provide so much disorganized information that essentially none of it is useful for the consumer-patient. The other forty-nine states do not require hospitals to disclose their chargemasters at all. In fact, hospitals fiercely guard these price lists.  

California laws may have planted a seed for change. Hospitals should publish their chargemasters in a standard, easy-to-understand format.  

#### Use Antitrust Law to Break Up Oversize Hospital Conglomerates

Healthcare has now reached the point where consolidation is leading to price inflation, with little benefit to patients.  

In this country, it's not illegal to have a monopoly and to use it to raise your price.  

#### Standards for Hospital Billing and Collection

There is no industry wide or legal standard about when medical accounts should be considered seriously delinquent. One hospital might send a bill to collections after 30 days, another after 120, and another not at all.  

The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has recommended reforming medical billing by including more fair and predictable timetables.  

## Chapter 15 - Insurance Costs

### Part 1. What You Can Start Doing Now

#### Selecting a Plan

Shopping for health insurance is perhaps the hardest task facing any consumer.  

Today you must consider the entire dizzying package. The premium: the amount you pay each month to be insured. The deductibles: the amount you pay each month to be insured. The co-payments and coinsurance: the patient's contribution for each medical purchase or encounter. The out-of-pocket maximum: the limit on how much you will be expected to pay in a given year, *if* you've played by the plan's rules. The network: the collection of contracted doctors and hospitals you must use in order to have the plan cover your care or, at least, to reap the plan's full financial benefits and promises.  

1. Premiums
1. Deductibles
1. Co-payments and coinsurance
1. Annual out-of-pocket maximum
1. The network
1. HMO options
1. Is a nonprofit right for you?

### Part 2. System Change: What We Want from Insurance

#### State Insurance Regulators

Consumers should be able to expect some fair standards from their health insurance policies:  

1. The network provider contract must be in force for the same period of time as the health insurance policy.  
1. If a procedure is listed as covered under a plan, then all tests and ancillary services normally associated with the procedure should also be covered.  
1. Provider directories must be kept up to date.  
1. A patient should pay only in-network fees if there is no other choice but to use a facility or a provider outside the network of treatment.  
1. Directories should not be able to list meaningless categories to describe doctors and hospitals.  
1. Streamline statements that define annual "out-of-pocket" maximum payments.  

Hire consumer advocates, not industry gadflies, as state insurance overseers.  

#### More Creative Plan Designs

1. Reference Pricing
1. Bundling
    Bundled payments give the medical world new incentives to find out what treatments actually work best.  
1. Insurance policies designed to meet patient needs

## Chapter 16 - Drug and Medical Device Costs

Americans comparison shop for cars, breads, electronics, and just about everything else except for prescription drugs.

### Part 1. What You Can Start Doing Right Now

Many expensive prescription medicines are just reformulations of older versions of the same drugs creatively repatented, not improved.  

#### Shop Around

The pharmacist may tell you if you have insurance you "have to use it." That is **not** the case: no law, no regulation, no waiver you've signed stipulates that you cannot pay cash for a prescription. What the pharmacy wants is the higher price and profit margin it obtains by forcing you to buy medicine through your insurance policy. Exercise your power as a consumer and either complain or have your prescription transferred to another pharmacy.

#### Consider Imports

If you need to take a drug but really can't afford it, you may want to consider buying it from a source outside the United States. The cost is likely to be one-third to one-half of the U.S. price.  

1. If you're traveling to a country whose health system you trust, buy refills of medicines there.  
1. Rely on overseas mail-order pharmacies to order long-term medicines whose efficacy can be clearly measured.  

#### Be Skeptical of Advertising and Marketing

### Part 2. System Change: What We Want from Manufacturers and Regulators

Doctors abroad are dumbstruck when they hear the prices we pay for pharmaceuticals.  

1. Import Drugs
1. Give pharmacists more prescribing power
1. The FDA should reform the patent process and revamp drug and device approval
1. Negotiate national prices
1. Promote pharmaceutical transparency, cost-effectiveness at all stages of the approval process

#### Doctors and Professional Organizations: Ally with Patients, not Pharma

When choosing treatments for a patient, we have to consider the financial strains they may cause alongside the benefits they might deliver.  

Use Charity Navigator to check how a charity spends its donations.  

## Chapter 17 - Bills for Tests and Ancillary Services

In the past, the costs of tests and ancillary services used to be covered by insurance with little or no patient contribution; today patients are often expected to foot at least part of the bill.

1. Protect your wallet: do not have any test or service performed by a provider outside your network.  
1. As a general rule, avoid having your ordinary blood and fluid specimens sent to a hospital lab.  
1. Ask the commercial lab for a printout of your results.  
1. Some situations demand top-dollar testing.  

## Chapter 18 - Better Healthcare in a Digital Age

In the last twenty-five years, nearly every aspect of our day-to-day lives has been made easier by digital technology: banking, watching films, traveling, communicating with loved ones near and far away, purchasing a new home. But healthcare is the exception to the rule.  
That is not because of a lack of investment. Silicon Valley is hot on healthcare.  

Health technology can be deployed for enormous patient good, but often all it offers up are useless, but profitable, services. If a company exists to untangle or parse the data in our convoluted system, the real answer is not to add another layer designed by entrepreneurs looking for profit, but to make the system simpler.  

### Part 1. How You Can (and Can't) Benefit from New Technologies Now

1. Wearables
1. Technology-enhanced screening
1. Telehealth

### Part 2. System Change: What We Want from Technology

We could be deriving enormous benefits from new technology, if only it was deployed with more forethought about how it might contribute to high-quality affordable healthcare rather than just bureaucratic record keeping and industry profit.  

#### The Means to Possess Your Medical Data

Right now our medical information is held captive in disparate doctors' offices and hospitals. That isolation translates into pointless expenses, because patients frequently have tests repeated. It means worse care, because doctors don't have previous test results for comparison.  

Full utility of stored medical information online (through start up companies like PicnicHealth) is limited at this time because many hospitals and doctors are not capable of sending or receiving your information in a standardized format.  
All that information could be placed on a chip card (or a smart device!) to carry in a wallet, which could be scanned by each new provider.  
It *could* be stored in a national data collection system akin to a credit agency like Equifax. If a public agency kept all records of all your medical encounters in a secure and searchable form, they could be made available to providers of your choosing.  

#### Connected Programs for Pricing and Scheduling

Thanks to digital technology you can price, book, and pay for a hotel in Tbilisi, Georgia, on your computer. Why can't you do the same for an X-ray down the road or a doctor's appointment?

## Epilogue

The mission of this book is to advocate for a return to a system of affordable, evidence-based, patient-centered care.  
No one player created the mess that is the $3 trillion American medical system. People in every sector of medicine are feeding at the trough: insurers, hospitals, doctors, manufacturers, politicians, regulators, charities, and more. People in sectors that have nothing to do with health - banking, real estate, and tech have also somehow found a way to extort cash from patients. They all need to change their money-chasing ways.  
To make that happen, we patients will need to change our ways too. We must become bolder, more active, and more thoughtful about what we demand of our healthcare and the people who deliver it. We must be more engaged in finding and pressing the political levers to promote the evolution of the medical care we deserve.  

It's our health, the future of our children, and our nation. High-priced healthcare is America's sickness and we are all paying, being robbed. When the medical industry presents us with the false choice of your money or your life, it's time for us all to take a stand for the latter.
