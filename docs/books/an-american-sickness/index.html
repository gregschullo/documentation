Instead it attends more or less on profits.  </p><p>The healthcare system is in disarray.</p><p>A common hospital experience includes dozens of doctors sending separate bills that are often undecipherable. The bills are large and and insurance pays a fraction.<br>
Imagine if you paid for an airplane ticket and then got separate, inscrutable bills from the airline. Separate bills from the airline, the pilot, the copilot, and the flight attendants. That&#x27;s how the healthcare market works.<br>
In no other industry do prices for a product vary by a factor depending on where it is purchased, as is the case for bills for echocardiograms, MRI scans, and blood tests to gauge thyroid functions, to vitamin D levels.<br>
The price of a Prius at a dealership in Princeton, New Jersey isn&#x27;t five times higher than what you would pay for a Prius in Hackensack or twice the price of a Prius in New Mexico. The price of that car at the very same dealer doesn&#x27;t depend on your employer, if your self-employed, or unemployed. Why is that the case for healthcare?</p><p>The United States spends nearly one-fifth of its gross domestic product on healthcare, more than $3 trillion per year.</p><p>H&amp;P - History and Physical - an organized and disciplined form of record keeping that every doctor uses. The H&amp;P is a remarkable template for understanding complex problems, such as sorting out a patient&#x27;s multitude of symptoms in order to diagnose properly and to allow for effective treatment. The H&amp;P has predictable components:</p><ul><li>Chief complaint - What major symptoms does the patient notice?</li><li>History of the present illness and review of symptoms - How did the problem evolve?</li><li>Diagnosis and treatment - What is the underlying cause? What can be done to resolve the patient&#x27;s illness or symptoms?</li></ul><p>The chief complaint is typically huge, expensive medical care that doesn&#x27;t reliably deliver quality results.</p><p>The economist Adam Smith spoke of an &quot;invisible hand&quot; with respect to income distribution. In American healthcare, there&#x27;s a different type of invisible hand at work: it&#x27;s on the till.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="chapter-1---the-age-of-insurance"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#chapter-1---the-age-of-insurance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Chapter 1 - The Age of Insurance</h2><p>Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.  </p><p>Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="the-history-in-the-beginning"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-history-in-the-beginning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>The History: In the Beginning</h3><p>The earliest health policies were designed to compensate for income lost while workers were ill. The original purpose of health insurance was to mitigate financial disasters brought about by serious illness  </p><p>The first health care insurance model was called Blue Cross Plans. The goal was not to make profit, but to protect patient savings and keep hospitals afloat  </p><p>Once acceptance of health insurance was widespread, a domino effect ensued: hospitals adapted to its financial incentives, which changed how doctors practiced medicine, which revolutionized the types of drugs and devices that manufacturers made and marketed. The money chase was on: no one was protecting the patients.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="chapter-2---the-age-of-hospitals"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#chapter-2---the-age-of-hospitals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Chapter 2 - The Age of Hospitals</h2><p>The cost of hospital services has grown faster than costs in other parts of our healthcare system. From 1997 to 2012, cost of hospital services grew 149% and physician service costs grew 55%.</p><p>Market economists refer to hospitals as &quot;sharks&quot; or &quot;spending machines.&quot; With few market forces to curb their behavior, they raise prices as much as they can. Because most hospitals are non-profits, they have no shareholders to answer to and cannot legally show a profit... so they spend money on executive compensation and building fancy gardens and lobbies.</p><p>There are armies of consultants whose job it is to improve revenue, compensation, and get their slice of the pie. 10% to 15% of revenue goes to billing and collection companies and contractors do things like claims and preapprovals... Those jobs don&#x27;t even exist in Europe.</p><p>There is so much surplus capacity, which should result in lower costs, but it doesn&#x27;t... We get the opposite. It&#x27;s a market failure but it follows certain logic. It&#x27;s not a healthcare system. It&#x27;s an industry. At every point there is a way to make money.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="a-doctors-view-one-hospitals-journey-from-charity-to-profit"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#a-doctors-view-one-hospitals-journey-from-charity-to-profit" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>A Doctor&#x27;s View: One Hospital&#x27;s Journey from Charity to Profit</h3><p>Healthcare has become a great way for the Catholic Church, in particular, to collect money. Eight of the ten largest nonprofit hospital systems in the United States have religious affiliations and names.</p><p>In 1960, Dr. Albert Starr, a Portland heart surgeon, revolutionized the treatment of heart disease by coinventing and then implanting the first successful artificial heart valve. Millions of patients who would otherwise be dead have benefited from that discovery. Dr. Starr was a medical rock star, a hero, a genuine draw. Yet he was never on a billboard... Marketing and advertising were considered unethical and looked down on. It just wasn&#x27;t done at that time.</p><p>In the 1960s, Medicare arrived to cover hospital payments. Between  1968 and 1980 the number of Americans under 65 covered by good, private insurance was at its peak (about 80%, compared to about 67% in 2007). <strong>Because patients were no longer forking out cash or writing checks for their care, hospitals began charging more for their services.</strong> The original Blues plan at Baylor had paid by the week for hospitalization, but now hospitals like Providence charged for each service at each encounter. In a world populated by doctors, nurses, and nuns, <strong>no one really knew how to figure out how much it cost the hospital to remove an appendix, for example.</strong> There was no harm in aiming high though, because insurers usually paid whatever was requested.</p><p>More money began coming in to hospitals, so there was a need to hire more business people to manage it. In the early 1980s, the increasingly powerful hospital administrators held degrees in business or healthcare administration and they paid more attention to the bottom line than to the tradition of medicine.</p><p>By the late 1990s, Providence hospital no longer wanted pay an ER or clinic doctors a salary. They treated them as independent contractors. That turned doctors into a business. They negotiated contracts that stipulated what percent of revenues that were deserved.</p><p>Economies of scale don&#x27;t translate to lower prices. With their market power, big providers can simply demand more.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="behind-the-scenes-how-hospitals-got-new-business-models"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#behind-the-scenes-how-hospitals-got-new-business-models" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Behind the Scenes: How Hospitals Got New Business Models</h3><p>The financial structure of a hospital, due to legal and philosophical constraints, has not developed in the same manners as that of commercial corporations. Hospitals are big businesses. Benefactors alone cannot subsidize hospital operations.</p><p>There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest prices of all.</p><p>Hospitals&#x27; administrators, controllers, and finance committees need accurate cost findings. Similar to executives of supermarkets or department store chains.</p><p>According to a 2011 article in the newspaper published by the American Medical Association, more business experience was needed to be a hospital executive. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) remains a common leadership position, but hospitals are creating positions such as chiefs of physical relations, integration, and medical informatics.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="enter-the-consultants"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#enter-the-consultants" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Enter the Consultants</h3><p>To ensure the U.S. healthcare system would grow in a cost-effective way, Congress passed a law in 1974 requiring state health-planning agencies to grant approval before hospitals could build new facilities or purchase expensive technology. Agencies granted &quot;certificates of need&quot; indicating the community would benefit from the investment. The goal was to avoid duplication of services and overbuilding. That law was rescinded in 1987, resulting in hospitals building whatever they wanted, so long as their revenues supported it. Medical purchases became investments and the medical arms race between hospitals was on.</p><p>In 2005, Deloitte hired Tommy Thompson (who had previously been secretary of health and human services) as chairman of its global healthcare practice, thereby lending a big name to its outreach in the new sector. Restructuring a hospital as if it were a steel mill or chicken processing plant seemed uncouth to some boards; but second-tier and financially struggling hospitals opened their doors to consultants.</p><p>Hospital reimbursement is a strategic puzzle. All hospitals have a master price list and adjusting it to maximize income was the focus of Deloitte&#x27;s strategy. To squeeze more money from the purse, Deloitte advised hospitals to stop billing for items such as gauze rolls, which insurers rarely reimbursed, and to boost charges for services like OR time, oxygen therapy, and prescription drugs. The strategy was all about optimizing payments by raising prices on certain items to cover the cost of other items. While it&#x27;s legal, it&#x27;s ethically dubious and not good for patients. It certainly increases the cost of healthcare.</p><p>For the business departments of hospitals and doctors on staff, the discovery was transformational. The billed price of an item could be completely decoupled from its actual cost. Items that had previously been included in the charge for the operating room or a hospital day could be billed separately.</p><p>Just about every hospital employs strategic billing, which is enabled and supported by consultants and healthcare advisory firms. Deloitte is ranked number one by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting - life sciences, payer, provider, and government health. In 2014 it announced record revenues of 34.2 billion dollars, fueled by more than 17% growth in the sector.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="strategic-billing-101-upcoding-and-facility-fees-lead-to-a-3400-needle-stick"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#strategic-billing-101-upcoding-and-facility-fees-lead-to-a-3400-needle-stick" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Strategic Billing 101: Upcoding and Facility Fees Lead to a $3,400 Needle Stick</h3><p>Upcoding: Doctors were charging things as simple as blood draws as level 5 on a 1 - 5 scale. &quot;Things that were written down and what was actually done bore little resemblance,&quot; recalls Dr. Richards. Coding creep (upcoding) grew bolder - until it made no sense at all. If needle sticks and eye infections are coded as level 5, what was a crushed chest from a car accident or a heart attack?</p><p>Dr. Donald Berwick, a former Medicare administrator, told the CPI that he believed most doctors were not breaking the law, just &quot;learning how to play the game.&quot;</p><p>Around 2000, a hospital decided it would no longer pay physicians a fixed salary; instead, they would be compensated in proportion to the relative value units (RVUs) of the care they dispensed. RVUs are a measure of productivity used to determine medical billing.</p><p>Facility fees also played a role in the rising cost of healthcare. Facility fees were a logical outgrowth of a period of rapid scientific progress in medicine, which allowed many treatments to move to an outpatient setting (a good thing, right?). Improvements in anesthesia, pain medicine, minimally invasive surgery, and biopsy techniques meant that many procedures and operations could be safely performed without an overnight stay. Because hospitals had traditionally charged a day rate for inpatients, it made sense that insurers (including Medicare) had largely accepted their new practice of charging facility fees for major outpatient care.</p><p>Facility fees are a unique construct of American healthcare and its business model. Hospitals in Europe don&#x27;t have them. Nor do other types of businesses in the United States. As Yevgeniy Feyman observed in <em>Health Affairs Blog,</em> &quot;When you buy anything - a watch, a car, even groceries - you pay a single price for the goods. The Walgreens down the street doesn&#x27;t add a separate charge to cover its rent, utilities, or the cost of refrigeration units.&quot;</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="closing-departments-make-money-or-die"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#closing-departments-make-money-or-die" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Closing Departments: Make Money or Die</h3><p>The new hospital consultants were experts not just in raising revenues with strategic pricing but also in corporate restructuring. Hospitals traditionally had departments that perennially lost money: emergency rooms, labor and delivery, dialysis centers, drug and treatment programs, and outpatient clinics in poorer neighborhoods that served Medicaid populations. These were part of their mission and a moral obligation (importantly, they also received federal funding to subsidize them). But by the early 2000s, every department had to carry its own weight.</p><p>As obesity rates climbed, medical equipment companies devised new operations using new products to help combat the condition, and bariatric surgery was a boom field. Companies, hospitals, and doctors&#x27; groups lobbied successfully to have insurers pay for it all. Being overweight was rebranded a disease.</p><p>New machines were purchased based not on medical necessity or even utility but according to financial calculation.</p><p>Rule 1: More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="the-business-of-medical-training-hospitals-and-cheap-labor"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-business-of-medical-training-hospitals-and-cheap-labor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>The Business of Medical Training: Hospitals and Cheap Labor</h3><p>By 2014 hospitals received about $15 billion a year in government subsidies to support graduate medical education, a number that had been &quot;increasing for decades.&quot; These payments include &quot;direct payments&quot; to compensate for the theoretical inefficiencies and institutional sacrifice involved in training new doctors, such as longer hospital stays and the need to order more tests for teaching purposes.<br>
Studies have not provided proof of those purported inefficiencies and sacrifices that merited special compensation. Stays in teaching hospitals are no longer than those without residents, for example.<br>
In fact, there is much to suggest that hospitals have turned residencies into another profitable business.<br>
They are learning but are also effectively low-wage labor.<br>
The median cost to a hospital for each full-time resident in 2013 was $134,803. That includes a salary of between $50,000 and $80,000. Federal support translates into about $100,000 per resident per year. Researchers have calculated that the value of the work each resident performs annually is $232,726.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="the-emergence-of-hospital-hotels"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-emergence-of-hospital-hotels" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>The Emergence of Hospital-Hotels</h3><p>&quot;There are an infinite number of ways to spend: amenities, scanners, salaries, building more.</p><p>Medicare pays hospitals a bonus for performing well on patient surveys, &quot;so if a patients asks for a test and it won&#x27;t hurt, they&#x27;ll get it. It&#x27;s good for Press Ganey scores. It takes more time and trouble to explain to a patient why they don&#x27;t need an X-ray, for example.&quot;</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="the-most-profitable-nonprofits-the-evolution-of-hospital-charity"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-most-profitable-nonprofits-the-evolution-of-hospital-charity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>The Most Profitable Nonprofits: The Evolution of Hospital Charity</h3><p>Not-for-profit hospitals are now just as profitable as capitalist corporations, but the excess money flowing in isn&#x27;t called &quot;profit&quot; - it&#x27;s &quot;operating surplus.&quot;</p><p>The <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> has uncovered many of the relevant numbers on UPMC: it is &quot;Allegheny County&#x27;s largest property owner, with 656 acres,&quot; 86% of which is tax exempt. If it were not classified as a nonprofit, &quot;UPMC would owe the city $20 million more in taxes every year.&quot;</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="observation-status-a-new-financial-purgatory-in-the-hospital"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#observation-status-a-new-financial-purgatory-in-the-hospital" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Observation Status: A New Financial Purgatory in the Hospital</h3><p>The idea of admitting a patient for &quot;observation&quot; has long been an important medical tool but was likely far more useful a few decades ago.<br>
As observation has become less important for diagnosis, it has become more important for lucrative billing construct, manipulated by hospitals, insurers, and nursing homes.</p><p>Medicare penalizes hospitals if patients bounce back thirty days after discharge - the &quot;readmission penalty.&quot; But if they were never officially admitted and were merely under &quot;observation&quot; they couldn&#x27;t bounce back.</p><p>For hospitals and insurers, observation status has benefit. For patients it is a disaster.</p><p>In 2015 President Obama signed a bill requiring hospitals to notify patients receiving more than twenty-four hours of observation care of their status as outpatients and its varied implications. But that notification comes after the fact, when patients are already supine in their hospital bed and can do little about it.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="chapter-3---the-age-of-physicians"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#chapter-3---the-age-of-physicians" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Chapter 3 - The Age of Physicians</h2><p>Surgeon pledge in 1990: &quot;I will set my fees commensurate with the services rendered.

Median income for hematologists and oncologists increased 35.6% to $350,000 and median income for diagnostic radiologists increased 36.2% to $407,000.

Medicare assigned that task to the American Medical Association (AMA). Allowing the AMA to determine doctors&#x27; payments is similar to letting the American Petroleum Institute decide what BP, Shell, and Exxon Mobile can charge us not just for gas, but for wind and solar power as well.

The first three are often referred to as the NPC (&quot;no patient contact:) specialists.<br>
Historically, these physicians were hospital employees and their services were embedded in hospital charges just like bandages and beds. They were paid decent salaries but no more. It&#x27;s surprising today they account for some of the highest, most confusing doctors&#x27; bills you&#x27;re likely to get.</p><p>By 2014, 65% of the nation&#x27;s five thousand hospitals had contracted out their emergency department staffing/management function. For those in the industry, it was a win-win situation. Hospitals no longer had to buy malpractice or health insurance or figure out how to staff vacations. Doctors could charge what they thought they were worth. But for patients, this meant the proliferation of separate bills for these doctors&#x27; services, from companies with mysterious return addresses in distant states.</p><p>The game with PARE specialists is they began to refuse to contract with any plan or insurer. &quot;These guys decide not to contract, so they can charge whatever they want.

All patients who turned up at the emergency room had to be treated, regardless of their ability to pay. Hospitals couldn&#x27;t turn away sick patients or pregnant women who were poor.

They do it with physician extenders. Physician extender is an umbrella term that refers to the trained ancillary personnel who help doctors and surgeons care for patients, including nurse practitioners, surgical technicians, physician assistants, and midwives.</p><p>Extending has also become a useful billing construct, enabling doctors to bill for work done by the extenders who work for and with them, as if the doctors themselves were personally dispensing the care. Slowly but surely, the idea that extenders&#x27; work constituted as &quot;billable hours&quot; became commonplace.</p><p>The doctor never saw the patient, never had any interaction with the patient, and yet a service can be billed under that physician?

He explained he came out to thinking our system of drug approval doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Because of the FDA&#x27;s criterion we were following to determine efficacy, he was forced to vote yes, but it made him uncomfortable as the drug was not demonstrably better than melatonin.<br>
FDA panels don&#x27;t consider the cost of products they review. Vanada&#x27;s Hetlioz was priced at $96,000 ($8,000 a month or $267 per dose)... Now there is a prescription drug that is not as effective as melatonin (which you can buy for $6 for a bottle of over 100 pills).<br>
It&#x27;s eye popping that we could get into this situation and that the new drug can be advertised on TV.<br>
Because melatonin is a product of nature the molecule can&#x27;t be patented. No company will go through the expensive testing and application process to get melatonin formulated as a prescription drug. It&#x27;s sold as a nutritional supplement and not regulated or tested with great exactitude. The proper dosing of melatonin has never been studied to FDA standards....

The usual price of the most common inhaled asthma medicine, albuterol, rose from about $10 to over $100. It costs $7 to $9 in Australia, where it&#x27;s still generic and even sold over the counter.</p><p>There are endless ways to extend your product&#x27;s value through manipulating FDA policies and patent law.</p><ul><li>File a lawsuit</li><li>Modify the delivery</li><li>Play to the FDA&#x27;s weaknesses and blind spots</li><li>Take it over the counter</li><li>Create a combination</li></ul><p><strong>File a lawsuit</strong> - Getting a patent only costs $20,000 and applications are unlimited. There&#x27;s strong motivation for drug companies to file weak patents. Brand makers take out weak patents, generics challenge them, and the brand makers answer back with an objection. Under Hatch-Waxman, that objection alone sets off a mandatory thirty-month halt in the FDA&#x27;s consideration of the generic entrant.</p><p><strong>Modify the delivery</strong> - Product hopping - moving products from one form to another. For example, changing a drug from a pill to a chewable tablet.<br>
Since generics must be identical in dosage and form to the brand-name drug for a pharmacist to substitute, companies can make moves to succeeded in delaying competition from generics for years.  </p><p><strong>Play to the FDA&#x27;s weakness and blindspots</strong> - Sprays, lotions, and creams don&#x27;t have to play legal games to fend off competition from generics since these formulations are hard to replicate according to the FDA&#x27;s extracting standards. For pills, it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to show the chemical composition is equivalent to the brand and to measure that it produces the same level of medication in the blood.</p><p><strong>Take it over the counter</strong> - Changing a drug&#x27;s legal status so it can be sold over the counter is sometimes a profitable patent play for pharmaceutical companies (known as an &quot;OTC switch&quot;), but it can be a risky decision.  Prescriptions are key to charging high prices (because insurers pay) and holding a pharmaceutical monopoly intact. In much of the world, products go over the counter when they are deemed safe enough to take without a doctor&#x27;s intervention. In the US, it is a business calculation.<br>
More treatment is always better, default to the most expensive option.<br>
An OTC switch makes products available to a wider audience of buyers but manufacturers have to lower the price considerable because insurance is no longer involved. They also have to establish brand recognition with consumers.<br>
According to US law, the same product cannot be on the market as both a prescription and an over-the-counter product.<br>
FDA grants any company that takes a prescription drug to OTC status three years of market exclusivity for that sales route, during which other manufacturers are forbidden from making store-brand copies.  </p><p><strong>Create a combination</strong> - Patient outrage over the high price of patent plays was the last business barrier drugmakers had to resolve. As pharmaceutical prices increased, insurers imposed co-payments that were a percentage of the bill to encourage the use of cheaper alternatives.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="desperate-patients-and-bribes-or-charity"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#desperate-patients-and-bribes-or-charity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Desperate Patients and Bribes, or Charity?</h3><p>More competitors vying for business doesn&#x27;t mean better prices.
