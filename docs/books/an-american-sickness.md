## Introduction - Complaint: Unaffordable Healthcare

The American medical system has stopped focusing on health and science. Instead it attends more or less on profits.  

The healthcare system is in disarray.

A common hospital experience includes dozens of doctors sending separate bills that are often undecipherable. The bills are large and and insurance pays a fraction.  
Imagine if you paid for an airplane ticket and then got separate, inscrutable bills from the airline. Separate bills from the airline, the pilot, the copilot, and the flight attendants. That's how the healthcare market works.  
In no other industry do prices for a product vary by a factor depending on where it is purchased, as is the case for bills for echocardiograms, MRI scans, and blood tests to gauge thyroid functions, to vitamin D levels.  
The price of a Prius at a dealership in Princeton, New Jersey isn't five times higher than what you would pay for a Prius in Hackensack or twice the price of a Prius in New Mexico. The price of that car at the very same dealer doesn't depend on your employer, if your self-employed, or unemployed. Why is that the case for healthcare?

The United States spends nearly one-fifth of its gross domestic product on healthcare, more than $3 trillion per year.

H&P - History and Physical - an organized and disciplined form of record keeping that every doctor uses. The H&P is a remarkable template for understanding complex problems, such as sorting out a patient's multitude of symptoms in order to diagnose properly and to allow for effective treatment. The H&P has predictable components:

- Chief complaint - What major symptoms does the patient notice?
- History of the present illness and review of symptoms - How did the problem evolve?
- Diagnosis and treatment - What is the underlying cause? What can be done to resolve the patient's illness or symptoms?

The chief complaint is typically huge, expensive medical care that doesn't reliably deliver quality results.

The economist Adam Smith spoke of an "invisible hand" with respect to income distribution. In American healthcare, there's a different type of invisible hand at work: it's on the till.

## Chapter 1 - The Age of Insurance

Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.  

Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear.

### The History: In the Beginning

The earliest health policies were designed to compensate for income lost while workers were ill. The original purpose of health insurance was to mitigate financial disasters brought about by serious illness  

The first health care insurance model was called Blue Cross Plans. The goal was not to make profit, but to protect patient savings and keep hospitals afloat  

Once acceptance of health insurance was widespread, a domino effect ensued: hospitals adapted to its financial incentives, which changed how doctors practiced medicine, which revolutionized the types of drugs and devices that manufacturers made and marketed. The money chase was on: no one was protecting the patients.  

## Chapter 2 - The Age of Hospitals

The cost of hospital services has grown faster than costs in other parts of our healthcare system. From 1997 to 2012, cost of hospital services grew 149% and physician service costs grew 55%.

Market economists refer to hospitals as "sharks" or "spending machines." With few market forces to curb their behavior, they raise prices as much as they can. Because most hospitals are non-profits, they have no shareholders to answer to and cannot legally show a profit... so they spend money on executive compensation and building fancy gardens and lobbies.

There are armies of consultants whose job it is to improve revenue, compensation, and get their slice of the pie. 10% to 15% of revenue goes to billing and collection companies and contractors do things like claims and preapprovals... Those jobs don't even exist in Europe.

There is so much surplus capacity, which should result in lower costs, but it doesn't... We get the opposite. It's a market failure but it follows certain logic. It's not a healthcare system. It's an industry. At every point there is a way to make money.

### A Doctor's View: One Hospital's Journey from Charity to Profit

Healthcare has become a great way for the Catholic Church, in particular, to collect money. Eight of the ten largest nonprofit hospital systems in the United States have religious affiliations and names.

In 1960, Dr. Albert Starr, a Portland heart surgeon, revolutionized the treatment of heart disease by coinventing and then implanting the first successful artificial heart valve. Millions of patients who would otherwise be dead have benefited from that discovery. Dr. Starr was a medical rock star, a hero, a genuine draw. Yet he was never on a billboard... Marketing and advertising were considered unethical and looked down on. It just wasn't done at that time.

In the 1960s, Medicare arrived to cover hospital payments. Between  1968 and 1980 the number of Americans under 65 covered by good, private insurance was at its peak (about 80%, compared to about 67% in 2007). **Because patients were no longer forking out cash or writing checks for their care, hospitals began charging more for their services.** The original Blues plan at Baylor had paid by the week for hospitalization, but now hospitals like Providence charged for each service at each encounter. In a world populated by doctors, nurses, and nuns, **no one really knew how to figure out how much it cost the hospital to remove an appendix, for example.** There was no harm in aiming high though, because insurers usually paid whatever was requested.

More money began coming in to hospitals, so there was a need to hire more business people to manage it. In the early 1980s, the increasingly powerful hospital administrators held degrees in business or healthcare administration and they paid more attention to the bottom line than to the tradition of medicine.

By the late 1990s, Providence hospital no longer wanted pay an ER or clinic doctors a salary. They treated them as independent contractors. That turned doctors into a business. They negotiated contracts that stipulated what percent of revenues that were deserved.

Economies of scale don't translate to lower prices. With their market power, big providers can simply demand more.

### Behind the Scenes: How Hospitals Got New Business Models

The financial structure of a hospital, due to legal and philosophical constraints, has not developed in the same manners as that of commercial corporations. Hospitals are big businesses. Benefactors alone cannot subsidize hospital operations.

There is no such thing as a fixed price for a procedure or test. The uninsured pay the highest prices of all.

Hospitals' administrators, controllers, and finance committees need accurate cost findings. Similar to executives of supermarkets or department store chains.

According to a 2011 article in the newspaper published by the American Medical Association, more business experience was needed to be a hospital executive. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) remains a common leadership position, but hospitals are creating positions such as chiefs of physical relations, integration, and medical informatics.

### Enter the Consultants

To ensure the U.S. healthcare system would grow in a cost-effective way, Congress passed a law in 1974 requiring state health-planning agencies to grant approval before hospitals could build new facilities or purchase expensive technology. Agencies granted "certificates of need" indicating the community would benefit from the investment. The goal was to avoid duplication of services and overbuilding. That law was rescinded in 1987, resulting in hospitals building whatever they wanted, so long as their revenues supported it. Medical purchases became investments and the medical arms race between hospitals was on.

In 2005, Deloitte hired Tommy Thompson (who had previously been secretary of health and human services) as chairman of its global healthcare practice, thereby lending a big name to its outreach in the new sector. Restructuring a hospital as if it were a steel mill or chicken processing plant seemed uncouth to some boards; but second-tier and financially struggling hospitals opened their doors to consultants.

Hospital reimbursement is a strategic puzzle. All hospitals have a master price list and adjusting it to maximize income was the focus of Deloitte's strategy. To squeeze more money from the purse, Deloitte advised hospitals to stop billing for items such as gauze rolls, which insurers rarely reimbursed, and to boost charges for services like OR time, oxygen therapy, and prescription drugs. The strategy was all about optimizing payments by raising prices on certain items to cover the cost of other items. While it's legal, it's ethically dubious and not good for patients. It certainly increases the cost of healthcare.

For the business departments of hospitals and doctors on staff, the discovery was transformational. The billed price of an item could be completely decoupled from its actual cost. Items that had previously been included in the charge for the operating room or a hospital day could be billed separately.

Just about every hospital employs strategic billing, which is enabled and supported by consultants and healthcare advisory firms. Deloitte is ranked number one by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting - life sciences, payer, provider, and government health. In 2014 it announced record revenues of 34.2 billion dollars, fueled by more than 17% growth in the sector.

### Strategic Billing 101: Upcoding and Facility Fees Lead to a $3,400 Needle Stick

Upcoding: Doctors were charging things as simple as blood draws as level 5 on a 1 - 5 scale. "Things that were written down and what was actually done bore little resemblance," recalls Dr. Richards. Coding creep (upcoding) grew bolder - until it made no sense at all. If needle sticks and eye infections are coded as level 5, what was a crushed chest from a car accident or a heart attack?

Dr. Donald Berwick, a former Medicare administrator, told the CPI that he believed most doctors were not breaking the law, just "learning how to play the game."

Around 2000, a hospital decided it would no longer pay physicians a fixed salary; instead, they would be compensated in proportion to the relative value units (RVUs) of the care they dispensed. RVUs are a measure of productivity used to determine medical billing.

Facility fees also played a role in the rising cost of healthcare. Facility fees were a logical outgrowth of a period of rapid scientific progress in medicine, which allowed many treatments to move to an outpatient setting (a good thing, right?). Improvements in anesthesia, pain medicine, minimally invasive surgery, and biopsy techniques meant that many procedures and operations could be safely performed without an overnight stay. Because hospitals had traditionally charged a day rate for inpatients, it made sense that insurers (including Medicare) had largely accepted their new practice of charging facility fees for major outpatient care.

Facility fees are a unique construct of American healthcare and its business model. Hospitals in Europe don't have them. Nor do other types of businesses in the United States. As Yevgeniy Feyman observed in *Health Affairs Blog,* "When you buy anything - a watch, a car, even groceries - you pay a single price for the goods. The Walgreens down the street doesn't add a separate charge to cover its rent, utilities, or the cost of refrigeration units."

### Closing Departments: Make Money or Die

The new hospital consultants were experts not just in raising revenues with strategic pricing but also in corporate restructuring. Hospitals traditionally had departments that perennially lost money: emergency rooms, labor and delivery, dialysis centers, drug and treatment programs, and outpatient clinics in poorer neighborhoods that served Medicaid populations. These were part of their mission and a moral obligation (importantly, they also received federal funding to subsidize them). But by the early 2000s, every department had to carry its own weight.

As obesity rates climbed, medical equipment companies devised new operations using new products to help combat the condition, and bariatric surgery was a boom field. Companies, hospitals, and doctors' groups lobbied successfully to have insurers pay for it all. Being overweight was rebranded a disease.

New machines were purchased based not on medical necessity or even utility but according to financial calculation.

Rule 1: More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.

### The Business of Medical Training: Hospitals and Cheap Labor

By 2014 hospitals received about $15 billion a year in government subsidies to support graduate medical education, a number that had been "increasing for decades." These payments include "direct payments" to compensate for the theoretical inefficiencies and institutional sacrifice involved in training new doctors, such as longer hospital stays and the need to order more tests for teaching purposes.  
Studies have not provided proof of those purported inefficiencies and sacrifices that merited special compensation. Stays in teaching hospitals are no longer than those without residents, for example.  
In fact, there is much to suggest that hospitals have turned residencies into another profitable business.  
They are learning but are also effectively low-wage labor.  
The median cost to a hospital for each full-time resident in 2013 was $134,803. That includes a salary of between $50,000 and $80,000. Federal support translates into about $100,000 per resident per year. Researchers have calculated that the value of the work each resident performs annually is $232,726.

### The Emergence of Hospital-Hotels

"There are an infinite number of ways to spend: amenities, scanners, salaries, building more.

Medicare pays hospitals a bonus for performing well on patient surveys, "so if a patients asks for a test and it won't hurt, they'll get it. It's good for Press Ganey scores. It takes more time and trouble to explain to a patient why they don't need an X-ray, for example."

### The Most Profitable Nonprofits: The Evolution of Hospital Charity

Not-for-profit hospitals are now just as profitable as capitalist corporations, but the excess money flowing in isn't called "profit" - it's "operating surplus."

The *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* has uncovered many of the relevant numbers on UPMC: it is "Allegheny County's largest property owner, with 656 acres," 86% of which is tax exempt. If it were not classified as a nonprofit, "UPMC would owe the city $20 million more in taxes every year."

### Observation Status: A New Financial Purgatory in the Hospital

The idea of admitting a patient for "observation" has long been an important medical tool but was likely far more useful a few decades ago.  
As observation has become less important for diagnosis, it has become more important for lucrative billing construct, manipulated by hospitals, insurers, and nursing homes.

Medicare penalizes hospitals if patients bounce back thirty days after discharge - the "readmission penalty." But if they were never officially admitted and were merely under "observation" they couldn't bounce back.

For hospitals and insurers, observation status has benefit. For patients it is a disaster.

In 2015 President Obama signed a bill requiring hospitals to notify patients receiving more than twenty-four hours of observation care of their status as outpatients and its varied implications. But that notification comes after the fact, when patients are already supine in their hospital bed and can do little about it.

## Chapter 3 - The Age of Physicians

Surgeon pledge in 1990: "I will set my fees commensurate with the services rendered. I will take no part in any arrangement such as fee splitting or itinerant surgery.

In 1990 the American College of Surgeons felt it was immoral to be an itinerant surgeon. The current surgeon pledge, adopted in 2004, had been amended to remove the ethical limitations.

Surgeons are not the only group of doctors watering down their moral commitments. The American Medical Association's code of ethics has similarly been diluted.

### What is a Doctor's Work Worth?

Being a doctor is deserving of reasonable compensation, but what is seen as reasonable has escalated to unusual heights. Doctors make more in the US than in other countries and the gap is high in specialties.

* Primary care doctors make about 40% more in the US than their German counterparts.
* US orthopedic surgeons make more than twice as much as similar German specialists.

As the number of salaries of hospital administrators has risen, doctors have wanted a cut of the profits.

### The Price of a Cure: A Brief History of Doctors' Finances

More competitors vying for business doesn't mean better prices; it can drive prices up, not down.

According to the Medical Group Management Association, median physician income for all primary care doctors increased 9.9% from 2000 - 2004, compared with 15.8% increase for all non-primary care specialists. Median income for hematologists and oncologists increased 35.6% to $350,000 and median income for diagnostic radiologists increased 36.2% to $407,000. Average real income for all Americans dropped 3% during that time.

### Doctors Get the Key to the Vault

With the new system, constant updates were needed to determine fair value and payment. Medicare assigned that task to the American Medical Association (AMA). Allowing the AMA to determine doctors' payments is similar to letting the American Petroleum Institute decide what BP, Shell, and Exxon Mobile can charge us not just for gas, but for wind and solar power as well. The AMA says the RUC represents the entire medical profession, but it is not really representative of practicing doctors.

Researchers have determined the all-important "time" component assigned to procedures is often wildly inaccurate. Better surgical approaches, computerized equipment, and more effective anesthesia means surgical times have often declined dramatically since the RBRVS was first used in 1992. The RUC determines the time it takes to perform a service by polling several dozen specialists who do the procedure, which is essentially asking them if they want to be paid more or not...

### Strategy #1: Doctor-Entrepreneur-Owner

Ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) became increasingly popular over the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s. More were owned and run by individual doctors and investors.

Doctors saw new income potential, because they could charge facility fees; room rentals for the suites where they applied their trade.

Neurologists opened sleep centers where patients could have their brain activity measured and breathing monitored for sleep apnea. Insurance was often billed from $5,000 to $10,000 a night. Regulators tried in vain to curb the practice by requiring physicians to disclose to patients in advance... But these disclosures usually came in a pile of paperwork to sign.

Minor interventions doctors had once performed in the office were moved into their centers for financial benefit.

### Strategy #2: The Hidden Doctors and Their Mysterious Bills

There are physicians who contribute to your care whom you may never see: pathologists, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and emergency medicine docs. The first three are often referred to as the NPC ("no patient contact:) specialists.  
Historically, these physicians were hospital employees and their services were embedded in hospital charges just like bandages and beds. They were paid decent salaries but no more. It's surprising today they account for some of the highest, most confusing doctors' bills you're likely to get.

By 2014, 65% of the nation's five thousand hospitals had contracted out their emergency department staffing/management function. For those in the industry, it was a win-win situation. Hospitals no longer had to buy malpractice or health insurance or figure out how to staff vacations. Doctors could charge what they thought they were worth. But for patients, this meant the proliferation of separate bills for these doctors' services, from companies with mysterious return addresses in distant states.

The game with PARE specialists is they began to refuse to contract with any plan or insurer. "These guys decide not to contract, so they can charge whatever they want. The patient is over the barrel."

### Strategy #3: The Pacts Doctors Make

In 1964 a statute called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) was designed to force hospitals to remember their long standing obligations in an era of more commercialized healthcare. All patients who turned up at the emergency room had to be treated, regardless of their ability to pay. Hospitals couldn't turn away sick patients or pregnant women who were poor. But EMTALA doesn't apply to physicians, who are free to pick and choose which patients to accept.

### Strategy #4: One Doctor for the Price of Two

Over the last 20 years many doctors have managed the feat of having two of themselves, at least for billing purposes. They do it with physician extenders. Physician extender is an umbrella term that refers to the trained ancillary personnel who help doctors and surgeons care for patients, including nurse practitioners, surgical technicians, physician assistants, and midwives.

Extending has also become a useful billing construct, enabling doctors to bill for work done by the extenders who work for and with them, as if the doctors themselves were personally dispensing the care. Slowly but surely, the idea that extenders' work constituted as "billable hours" became commonplace.

The doctor never saw the patient, never had any interaction with the patient, and yet a service can be billed under that physician? Under many private payers, it is not fraud.

### Strategy #5: Selling Stuff - Buy and Bill

More treatment is always better. Default to the most expensive option.

Whistle blower lawsuits filed against makers of drugs and devices, alleging bribes and kickbacks to induce doctors to use and overuse high priced products, have become a staple of legal dockets

Oncologists prospered buying chemotherapy drugs from manufacturers and infusing them in the office, generally with a hefty markup, a practice known as "buy and bill." As the wholesale price of new drugs jumped again and again, doctors had little motivation to complain because they were allowed a markup that was often a set percentage of cost. Doctors who used more expensive drugs earned far more. The practice of buy and bill increased dramatically in the late 1990s and into the new century.

As technologies age, prices can rise rather than fall.

There is no free choice. Patients are stuck and they are stuck buying American.

### Strategy #6: Upgrades

Medical progress had proved great for patients but not for ophthalmologists' incomes. Doctors have done their best to fix that shortfall.

After discovering that ophthalmologic practices were advertising laser cataract surgery, Medicare issued a "guidance." Making an incision - whether by scalpel or laser - was considered part of the surgery fee and could not be billed separately. If patients really wanted "laser" surgery they would - once again - have to pay for it themselves.

Amenities and marketing matter more than good care.

### Strategy #7: Adopt a Surgical Procedure - Money, Money Everywhere

Thousands of physicians made more than $1,000,000 each from Medicare in 2012 and dozens more than $10,000,000.

Medicine is a business. It won't police itself. People have lost faith in the American medical profession - that they would act differently than other businesses - but they were wrong.
