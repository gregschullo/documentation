A good incident management process requires three things:

1. A process for declaring incidents
    - this includes thresholds for when an incident is to be declared and who can open incidents
1. Dashboards for viewing current incidents
1. Documentation of who to contact for each kind of incident

Necessary roles in managing an incident may include:  

Incident Commander (IC)  
Operations Lead  
Communications Lead  
Planning Lead  
Logistics Lead
