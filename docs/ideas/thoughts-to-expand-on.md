title: Thoughts that Require More Thought
---

## Finance

Curiosity is a luxury reserved for the financially secure.  

The most powerful advantage of money: the ability to think of things other than money.  

Financial loopholes exist simply for those who care enough about them to exploit them.  

## Hiring

If we only rely on metrics when hiring, we’re going to rely on this weird, watered down thing.

## Motivation

Single biggest driver of meaning at work: The belief that your actions in your job have a positive impact on other people.  
Ask: If my job didn’t exist, who would be worse off?

For a lot of people in a lot of industries, a meaning vacuum exists. They don’t really know who the clients or customers or end users are who are affected by their work. Many people never get to meet the people who drive the cars they design or use they software they write.  

Motivation is about designing a meaningful job. Pay is what you do to show appreciation.  

## Technology

Technology empowers us to be more capable humans, but also runs the risk of dehumanizing us as well.  

- Good code and proper testing and how
- Documentation as code
  - Transparency
  - Contribution
    - public documentation
      - no need to reinvent the wheel
      - unknown what value or inspiration can strike from your work being viewed by someone else
  - Automation
- Hiring for building a strong engineering culture
  - hire intrinsically motivated individuals
  - curiosity is crucial. - want to find and fix problems
  - Continuous Improvement and constant growth
  - Opposite of Stagnant - Content with role, just showing up and doing "your job"
    - Example: Show up to Assembly Line compared to IT now... Engineers should be looking for ways to get rid of those repetitive, predictable tasks (assembly line tasks)
  - Leveraging Opensource create opportunity for recruiting good talent and creates an opportunity for good hiring
- Improving daily work is more important than doing daily work
- Difference between engineering and developing
  - Engineers engineer around problems and walls that have been put up.
- Building an engineering team
  - A team most likely has different skill sets, but it's important to maintain some overlap for each component of an application. Everyone does not need to know everything, but you still want enough overlap to allow people to take time off, for example.
