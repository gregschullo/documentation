Mentality over any skillset

* Curiosity is most important. You can't teach curiosity or intrinsic motivation.

Not just opening a ticket to Unix or another team to solve issues. Important to dig in yourself and want to know why things break or how they work.

Digging into the new trends before they are even at the company. Understand what they are before they even get to Optum. Drive the change!

Want to solve problems

Be curious

Different backgrounds and different skillsets are healthy and encouraged.

I think the best advice I can give upfront is to learn the business requirements of the application and how the business expects a user to interact with it - then comb through the application and question every minute detail that’s outside of the requirements. Focus on Utilization, Saturation and Errors that users face through the application workflows. Document everything, prioritize, and then just start fixing what you can.

If someone says you can’t fix it, ask them why

Of course automate all the things :)
