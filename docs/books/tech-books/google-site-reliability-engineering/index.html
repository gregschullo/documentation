Direct Costs and Indirect Costs</li><li>Direct Costs are not subtle or ambiguous</li><li>Indirect Costs are often subtle and often more costly to the organization than direct costs</li></ul><p>Google&#x27;s Approach to Service Management: Site Reliability Engineering</p><ul><li>Site Reliability Engineering is what you get when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team</li><li>By design, it&#x27;s crucial SRE teams are focused on engineering. Without constant engineering, operations load increases and teams will need more people just to keep pace with the workload and doing the same tasks over and over.</li></ul><p>Pursuing Maximum Change Velocity Without Violating a Service’s SLO</p><ul><li>Error Budget - Shooting for 100% reliability is wrong for basically everything. Users receive little benefit between 99.999% and 100%</li><li>The correct reliability to shoot for is not a technical question, but a production one. Some questions to take into consideration should be:<ol><li>What level of availability will the users be happy with, given how they use the product?</li><li>What alternatives are available to users who are dissatisfied with the product’s availability?</li><li>What happens to users’ usage of the product at different availability levels?</li></ol><ul><li>The business must determine the availability target. Once established, the error budget is one minus the availability target. A service that is 99.99% available is 0.01% unavailable. The permitted 0.01% unavailability is the error budget, which can be spent on anything you want as long as you don&#x27;t overspend.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Monitoring</p><ul><li>Monitoring is one of the primary means by which service owners keep track of a system’s health and availability.</li><li>There are 3 kinds of valid monitoring output<ol><li>Alerts</li></ol><ul><li>Need to be handled by a human immediately</li></ul><ol><li>Tickets</li></ol><ul><li>Signify that humans need to take action, but not immediately</li></ul><ol><li>Logging</li></ol><ul><li>No one needs to look at this information, but it is recorded for diagnostic or forensic purposes.

A user cannot tell the difference between 99.99 and 99.999% uptime. With this in mind, rather than maximizing uptime, Site Reliability Engineering seeks to balance the risk of unavailability with the goals of rapid innovation and efficient service operations, so users&#x27; overall happiness with features, service, and performance is optimized.</li></ul><p>Measuring Service Risk</p><p>Time Based Availability</p><ul><li>Availability = uptime/(uptime+downtime)</li><li>Instead of using metrics around uptime, define availability in terms of request success rate (Aggregate Availability)</li></ul><p>Aggregate Availability</p><ul><li>Availability = successful requests/total requests</li><li>In a typical application, not all requests are equal</li><li>It is best practice to test a new release on a small subset of a typical workload.

A dashboard may have filters, selectors, and so on, but is prebuilt to expose the metrics most important to its users. The dashboard might also display team information such as ticket queue length, a list of high-priority bugs, the current on-call engineer for a given area of responsibility, or recent pushes.</p><p>Alert - A notification intended to be read by a human and that is pushed to a system such as a bug or ticket queue, an email alias, or a pager. Respectively, these alerts are classified as tickets, email alerts, and pages.</p><p>Root Cause - A defect in a software or human system that, if repaired, instills confidence that this event won’t happen again in the same way. A given incident might have multiple root causes: for example, perhaps it was caused by a combination of insufficient process automation, software that crashed on bogus input, and insufficient testing of the script used to generate the configuration. Each of these factors might stand alone as a root cause, and each should be repaired.</p><p>Node and Machine - Used interchangeably to indicate a single instance of a running kernel in either a physical server, virtual machine, or container. There might be multiple services worth monitoring on a single machine. The services may either be:</p><ul><li>a. Related to each other: for example, a caching server and a web server</li><li>b. Unrelated services sharing hardware: for example, a code repository and a master for a configuration system like Puppet or Chef<ul><li>Push - Any change to a service’s running software or its configuration.</li></ul></li></ul><p>WHY MONITOR?</p><ul><li>Analyze long term trends</li><li>Comparing over time or comparing experiment groups</li><li>Alerting</li><li>Building dashboards</li><li>Debugging</li></ul><p>The 4 Golden Signals</p><ul><li><p>The four golden signals of monitoring are latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. If you can only measure four metrics of your user-facing system, focus on these four.</p><ol><li>Latency - The time it takes to service a request</li><li>Traffic - A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system</li><li>Errors - The rate of requests that fail</li><li>Saturation - How &quot;full&quot; your system is.</li></ol></li><li><p>When creating rules for monitoring and alerting, asking the following questions can help you avoid false positives and pager burnout</p></li><li><p>Does this rule detect an otherwise undetected condition that is urgent, actionable, and actively or imminently user-visible?</p></li><li><p>Will I ever be able to ignore this alert, knowing it’s benign? When and why will I be able to ignore this alert, and how can I avoid this scenario?</p></li><li><p>Does the alert definitely indicate that users are being negatively affected? Are there detectable cases in which users aren’t being negatively impacted, such as test deployments that should be filtered out?</p></li><li><p>Can I take action in response to this alert? Is that action urgent, or could it wait until morning? Could the action be safely automated? Will that action be a long-term fix, or just a short-term workaround?</p></li><li><p>The alert system should be designed to alert on imminent real problems, alert on potential long term problems, and support rapid diagnosis.</p></li><li><p>These questions reflect a fundamental philosophy on pages and pagers:</p></li><li><p>Every time the pager goes off, I should be able to react with a sense of urgency. I can only react with a sense of urgency a few times a day before I become fatigued.</p></li><li><p>Every page should be actionable.</p></li><li><p>Every page response should require intelligence.

A multi-site team is advantageous for two reasons.</li><li>Night shifts have detrimental effects on people&#x27;s health, and a multi-site &quot;follow the sun&quot; rotation allows teams to avoid night shifts all together.</li><li>Limiting the number of engineers in the on-call rotation ensures that engineers do not lose touch with the production system(s).</li><li>However, multi-site teams input communication and coordination overhead. Therefore, the decision to go multi-site or single-site should be based upon the trade-offs each option entails, the importance of the system, and the workload each system generates.</li></ul><p>Balance in Quality</p><ul><li>For each on call shift, an engineer should have sufficient time to deal with any incidents and follow-up activities such as writing postmortems. Google has found that on average, dealing with the tasks involved in an on-call incident - root-cause analysis, remediation, and follow-up activities (like writing a postmortem and fixing bugs) takes about 6 hours.</li></ul><p>Compensation</p><ul><li>Adequate compensation needs to be considered for out-of-hours support. Different organizations handle on-call compensation in different ways; Google offers time-off-in-lieu or straight cash compensation, capped at some proportion of overall salary. The compensation cap represents, in practice, a limit on the amount of on-call work that will be taken on by any individual. This compensation structure ensures incentivization to be involved in on-call duties as required by the team, but also promotes a balanced on-call work distribution and limits potential drawbacks of excessive on-call work, such as burnout or inadequate time for project work.</li></ul><p>Feeling Safe</p><ul><li><p>Being an SRE on-call typically means assuming responsibility for user-facing, revenue-critical systems or for the infrastructure required to keep these systems up and running.</p></li><li><p>Modern research identifies two distinct ways of thinking that an individual may (consciously or subconsciously) choose when faced with a challenge:</p></li><li><p>Intuitive, automatic, and rapid action</p></li><li><p>Rational, focused, and deliberate cognitive functions</p></li><li><p>When one is dealing with outages related to complex systems, the second option is more likely to produce better results and lead to well planned incident handling.</p></li><li><p>To ensure that engineers are in the appropriate frame of mind to leverage the mindset of rational, focused, and deliberate cognitive functions, it is important to reduce the stress related to being on-call. The importance and the impact of the services and the consequences of potential outages can create significant pressure on the on-call engineers, damaging the well-being of individual team members and possibly prompting SREs to make incorrect choices that can endanger the availability of the service. Stress hormones like cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are known to cause behavioral consequences—including fear—that can impair cognitive functions and cause suboptimal decision making</p></li><li><p>Under the influence of these stress hormones, the more deliberate cognitive approach is typically subsumed by unreflective and unconsidered (but immediate) action, leading to potential abuse of heuristics. Heuristics are very tempting behaviors when one is on-call. For example, when the same alert pages for the fourth time in the week, and the previous three pages were initiated by an external infrastructure system, it is extremely tempting to exercise confirmation bias by automatically associating this fourth occurrence of the problem with the previous cause.</p></li><li><p>While intuition and quick reactions can seem like desirable traits in the middle of incident management, they have downsides. Intuition can be wrong and is often less supportable by obvious data. Thus, following intuition can lead an engineer to waste time pursuing a line of reasoning that is incorrect from the start. Quick reactions are deep-rooted in habit, and habitual responses are unconsidered, which means they can be disastrous. The ideal methodology in incident management strikes the perfect balance of taking steps at the desired pace when enough data is available to make a reasonable decision while simultaneously critically examining your assumptions.</p></li><li><p>It’s important that on-call SREs understand that they can rely on several resources that make the experience of being on-call less daunting than it may seem. The most important on-call resources are:</p><ul><li>Clear escalation paths</li><li>Well-defined incident-management procedures</li><li>A blameless postmortem culture  <ul><li>It should always be possible to escalate to a partner team when necessary. Appropriate escalation of outages is generally a principled way to react to serious outages with significant unknown dimensions (what does that mean?)</li><li>When an incident occurs, it&#x27;s important to evaluate what went wrong, recognize what went well, and take action to prevent the same errors from happening again in the future.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Focus on events rather than people. </p><ul><li>Mistakes happen, and software should make sure that we make as few mistakes as possible.</li><li>Recognize automation opportunities. It&#x27;s one of the best ways to prevent human error.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Avoiding Inappropriate Operational Load</p><ul><li>Misconfigured monitoring is a common cause of operational overload.</li><li>Paging alerts should be aligned with the symptoms that threaten a service&#x27;s SLOs</li><li>All paging alerts should be actionable</li><li>Low priority, frequent alerts disrupt productivity and can cause serious alerts to be treated less seriously </li><li>It is important to control the number of alerts for a single incident</li><li>Silence duplicate or uninformative alerts generated by a single incident</li><li>SRE teams should be sized to allow every engineer to be on call at least once or twice a quarter. This allows for familiarity with the production system(s) and addresses an appropriate confidence level.</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="chapter-12---effective-troubleshooting"></a>Chapter 12 - Effective Troubleshooting<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#chapter-12---effective-troubleshooting" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/effective-troubleshooting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/effective-troubleshooting/</a></p><ul><li>We can think of the troubleshooting process as an application of the hypothetico-deductive method: given a set of observations about a system and a theoretical basis for understanding system behavior, we iteratively hypothesize potential causes for failure and try to test those hypotheses.</li><li>A process for troubleshooting

The Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) measures how long it takes the operations team to fix the bug, either through a rollback or another action.</li><li>It&#x27;s possible for a testing system to identify a bug with zero MTTR. Zero MTTR occurs when a system-level test is applied to a subsystem and that test detects the exact same problem that monitoring would detect. The more bugs you can find with zero MTTR, the higher the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) experienced by your users.</li></ul><p>Types of Software Testing</p><ul><li><p>Software testing can be broken out into two main groups. Traditional and Production. Traditional tests are common in software development where production tests are performed on live web services to evaluate whether a deployed software system is working correctly.</p></li><li><p>Traditional Tests</p><ul><li>Hierarchy of Traditional Tests</li><li>Unit Tests - A unit test is the smallest and simplest form of software testing employed to assess a separable unit of software, such as a class or function for correctness independent of the larger software system containing the unit. Unit tests are also employed as a form of specification to ensure that a function or module exactly performs the behavior required by the system and are commonly used to introduce test-driven development concepts.</li><li>Integration Tests - Software components that pass individual unit tests are assembled into larger components. Integration tests are then run on an assembled component to verify that if functions correctly. Dependency injection is an extremely powerful technique for creating mocks of complex dependencies to an engineer can cleanly test a component.<br>Example: Replace a stateful database with a lightweight mock that has precisely specified behavior.</li><li>System Tests - The largest scale test that engineers run for an undeployed system. All modules belonging to a specific component, such as a server that  passed integration tests, are assembled into the system. Then the end to end functionality of the system is tested in many different flavors:<ul><li>Smoke Tests - tests where simple but critical behavior is evaluated. Also known as sanity testing.</li><li>Performance Tests - test to ensure performance of the system stays acceptable over the duration of its lifecycle. A performance test also ensures that over time, a system doesn&#x27;t degrade or become too expensive.</li><li>Regression Tests - test to prevent bugs from entering the codebase. Document bugs and don&#x27;t accidentally introduce bugs that have already invested time and effort to eliminate back into the codebase.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Production Tests - tests that interact with a live, production system, as opposed to a system in a hermetic testing environment. These tests are in many ways similar to black-box monitoring and are sometimes called black-box tests. Production tests are essential to running a reliable production service.</p><ul><li>Rollout Entangle Test - to manage uncertainty and hide risk from users, changes may be pushed in a different order than they were added to source control. Rollouts often happen in stages, using mechanisms that gradually shuffle users around, in addition to monitoring at each stage to ensure that the new environment isn&#x27;t hitting anticipated, yet unexpected problems.</li><li>Configuration Test - tests that examine production to see how a particular binary is actually configured and reports discrepancies against that file. Configuration tests are built and tested for a specific version of the checked-in configuration file.</li><li>Stress Test - tests used to understand the limits of the system and its components. Stress tests answer questions such as, how full can a database get before writes start to fail or how many queries a second can be sent to an application server before it comes overloaded, causing requests to fail?</li><li>Canary Test - test where a subset of components (servers is a good example) are upgraded to a new version or configuration and then left in an incubation period, leaving the rest of the components in a known good state. Provided things don&#x27;t go awry, the rest of the components are upgraded as well. If things do go awry, those upgraded components may be quickly restored to a known good state.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Creating a Test and Build Environment</p><ul><li><p>Start with testing that delivers the most impact with the least effort.</p><ul><li>Prioritize the codebase and focus on functions or classes that are mission and business critical.</li></ul></li><li><p>A few ways to establish a strong testing culture is to start documenting all reported bugs as test cases and to set up testing infrastructure with versioned source control that tracks every change to a codebase.</p><ul><li>Once source control is in place, the addition of a continuous build system that builds software and runs tests every time code is submitted is very helpful.</li></ul></li><li><p>When the build system notifies engineers of an issue, it is crucial that fixing it becomes top priority for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>It&#x27;s harder to fix what is broken if there are changes to the codebase after the defect is introduced</li><li>Broken software slows down the team because they must work around the breakage</li><li>Release cadences, such as nightly and weekly builds, lose their value</li><li>The ability of the team to respond to a request for an emergency release (for example, in response to a security vulnerability disclosure) becomes much more complex and difficult.  </li></ul></li></ul><p>Testing Disaster</p><ul><li>Many disaster recovery tools can be carefully designed to operate offline. Such tools do the following:<ul><li>Compute a checkpoint state that is equivalent to cleanly stopping the service</li><li>Push the checkpoint state to be loadable by existing non-disaster validation tools</li><li>Support the usual release barrier tools, which trigger the clean start procedure</li></ul></li></ul><p>Pushing to Production</p><ul><li>Software testing infrastructure often can&#x27;t see production configuration</li></ul><p>Testing is one of the most profitable investments engineers can make to improve the reliability of their product.</p><p>Testing is a continuous activity.</p><p>The amount of effort required to write good tests is substantial, as is the effort to build and maintain infrastructure that promotes a strong testing culture.</p><p>You can&#x27;t fix a problem until you understand it, and in engineering, you can only understand a problem by measuring it.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="chapter-18---software-engineering-in-sre"></a>Chapter 18 -
