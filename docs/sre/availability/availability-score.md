title: Availability Score
---

Availability is dependent on optimal supportability.  

Monitoring improves service availability and MTTR by increasing supportability.  

What is supportability?  
Supportability is an ongoing effort to:  
Improve the accuracy and completeness of a service’s information  
Reduce the time to engage, time to restore and impact to users during high priority incidents  

Scope: All High Priority Services  
Ask: “Are we as ready as we can be?”  
Murphy’s Law ….."Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong."  
It’s not a matter of IF, it’s a matter of WHEN impact will occur  

The true availability score (not Adjusted Down Time in Minutes (ADTM) represents 2 things:  

1. A measurement of the number of customers we disappointed today.  
1. A prediction of the number of customers we will disappoint tomorrow.  

Ability to measure this score depends heavily on following industry standards in monitoring.
