We have developed a bad case of "please like me culture"  
It has lead to low self esteem and other issues.  

Social media has contributed to this.  

There needs to be a lot more apathy about a lot more things.  

There's nothing wrong with owning possesions, accomplishing goals, traveling, or making money. Just don't think you're impressing anyone. At least not in the a meaningful way.
