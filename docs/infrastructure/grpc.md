RPC - Remote Procedure Call
An RPC is when a computer program causes a procedure to execute in a different address space which is coded as if it were a normal procedure call without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.

gRPC is a RPC initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or non-blocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages. Most common usage scenarios include connecting services in microservices style architecture and connect mobile devices, browser clients to back-end services.
