<p>How can we be sure we have the right information at hand to complete a task and how can we be sure we are applying that knowledge correctly?</p>
<p>A building is like a body. It has a skin, a skeletal system (frame), a vascular system (plumbing), a breathing system (ventalation), and a nervous system (wiring). Construction projects involve many different trades and each trade contributes separately, yet must fit together and make sense as a whole. We see similar situations in IT. How do we understand the entirety of an application to seamlessly create building and maintenance checklists for all the different contributors?</p>
<p>It is wise not to soley depend on the wisdom of the single individual, even an experienced engineer. Depending on the wisdom of the group and putting more sets of eyes on problems. Trust the power of communication when unexpected issues arise.</p>

<p>Give people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All that should be expected is that people talk to each other and take responsibility. That is what works.</p>
<p>Under conditions of true complexity - where the knowledge required exceeds that of any individual and unpredictability reigns - efforts to dictate every step from the center will fail. People need room to act and adapt.</p>

<p>Bad checklists are vague and imprecise. They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical. They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in which they are to be deployed. They treat the people using the tool as dumb and try to spell out every single step. They turn people's brains off rather than turn them on.</p>
<p>Good checklists are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in difficult situations. They do not spell everything out. A checklist cannot fly an airplane, perform heart surgery, or make production changes to an application. Instead, they simply provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps - steps that even highly trained and skilled professionals could miss. Good checklists are above all, practical.</p>
<p>The power of checklists is limited. They can help experts remember how to manage a complex process or configure a complex machine. They can make priorities clearer and prompt people to function better as a team. <strong>Checklists cannot make anyone follow them.</strong></p>
<p>Pilots turn to their checklists for two reasons. First, they are trained to do so. They learn from the beginning of flight school that their <strong>memory and judgement are unreliable and that lives depend on their recognizing that fact.</strong> Second, the checklists have proved their worth - they work.</p>
<p>However much pilots are taught to trust their procedures more than their instincts, that doesn't mean they do so blindly.</p>
<p>When you are making a checklist, there are a number of key decisions. You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used (unless the moment is obvious, like a warning light or alert goes off). You must decide if you want to create a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist.</p>
<p>DO-CONFIRM checklist - a list that is checked after tasks or jobs are performed from memory and experience to ensure that everything was done that was supposed to be.</p>
<p>READ-DO checklist - a list that is carried out step by step and tasks or jobs are checked off as they are performed. This type pf checklist is more like a recipe.</p>
<p>Checklists cannot be lengthy. A general rule of thumb is to keep checklists between five and nine items, which is the limit of working memory.</p>
<p>After about sixty to ninety seconds at a given pause point, a checklist often becomes a distraction from other things. People start &quot;shortcutting.&quot; Steps get missed. Keep lists short by focusing on &quot;the killer items.&quot;</p>
<p>No matter how careful we are or how much thought we put in to a checklist, they have to be tested in the real world. This can be more complicated than expected, but it is necessary.</p>
<p>Certain critical or important steps may be intentionally omitted if it is proven professionals rarely fail to perform the step. An example of this may be a professional pilot almost never fails to notify radio control of landing in emergencies. If this step is almost never missed, it should NOT be included in the checklist.</p>
<p>It is common to misconceive how checklists functionin complex lines of work. <strong>They are not comprehensive how-to guides.</strong> They are quick and simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert professionals.</p>
<p>A reason for delay in adopting change is not usually unwillingness or laziness. It is more often the necessary knowledge has not been translated into a simple, usable, and systematic form.</p>

<p>Using a checklist involved a major cultural change - a shift in authority, responsibility, and expectations.</p>
<p>However straightforward a checklist might appear, if you are used to getting along without one, incorporating one into the routine is not always a smooth process.</p>

<p>Even the most expert among us can gain from searching out the patterns of mistakes and failures and putting a few checks in place.</p>
<p>Just ticking boxes is not the ultimate goal here. Embracing a culture of teamwork and discipline is.</p>
<p>We can devise emergency checklists, like aviation has, for nonroutine situations.</p>
<p>The fear people have about the idea of adherence to protocol is rigidity. They imagine mindless automatons, heads down in a checklist, incapable of looking out their windshield and coping with the real world in front of them. What you find however, is when a checklist is well made, exactly the opposite proves true. The checklist gets the dumb stuff out of the way, the routines your brain shouldn't have to occupy itself with and lets it rise above to focus on the hard stuff.</p>
<p>All learned occupations have a definition of professionalism, a code of conduct. It is where they spell out their ideals and duties. The codes are sometimes stated, sometimes just understood. But they all have at least three common elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>An expectation of selflessness. We who accept responsibility for others - whether we are doctors, lawyers, teachers, public authorities, soldiers, or pilots - will place the needs and concerns of those who depend on us above our own.</li>
<li>An expectation of skill. We will aim for excellence in our knowledge and expertise.</li>
<li>An expectation of trustworthiness. We will be responsible in our personal behavior toward our changes.</li>
<li>Aviators add a fourth expectation. <strong>Discipline</strong>. Discipline in following prudent procedure and in functioning with others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Discipline is hard - harder tan trustworthiness, skill, and perhaps even selflessness. We are by nature flawed and inconsistent creatures. We can't even keep from snacking between meals. We are not built for discipline. We are built for novelty and excitement, not for careful attention to detail. Discipline is something we have to work at.</p>
<p>Airline manufacturers put a publication date on all their checklists, and there is a reason why. They are expected to change with time. In the end, a checklist is only an aid. If it doesn't aid, it's not right.</p>
<p>We have recently turned to the computer as our aid. Computers hold out the prospect of automation as our bulwark against failure. Indeed, they can take huge numbers of tasks off our hands. Without question, technology can increase our capabilities, but there is a lot technology can't do. Technology does not deal well with the unpredictable, manage uncertainty, construct entire buildings, or perform a lifesaving operation. In some ways, technology has complicated these matters. It has added another layer of complexity to the systems we depend on and have given us entirely new kinds of failures to contend with.</p>
<p>Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence. An example of this is the famous thought experiment of trying to build the world's greatest car by assembling the world's greatest car parts. Parts connected were the engine of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, the suspension of a BMW, and the body of a Volvo. Of course, the result was nothing close to a great car. The result was a very expensive pile of junk.</p>
<p>We don't study routine failures in teaching, in law, in government programs, in the finance industry, or elsewhere. We don't look for patterns of our recurrent mistakes or devise and refine potential solutions for them.</p>
<p>When we look closely, we recognize the same balls being dropped over and over, even by those of great ability and determination. We know the patterns. We see the costs. It's time to try something else. Try a checklist.</p>
