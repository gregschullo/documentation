## Introduction - Complaint: Unaffordable Healthcare

The American medical system has stopped focusing on health and science. Instead it attends more or less on profits.  

The healthcare system is in disarray.

A common hospital experience includes dozens of doctors sending separate bills that are often undecipherable. The bills are large and and insurance pays a fraction.  
Imagine if you paid for an airplane ticket and then got separate, inscrutable bills from the airline. Separate bills from the airline, the pilot, the copilot, and the flight attendants. That's how the healthcare market works.  
In no other industry do prices for a product vary by a factor depending on where it is purchased, as is the case for bills for echocardiograms, MRI scans, and blood tests to gauge thyroid functions, to vitamin D levels.  
The price of a Prius at a dealership in Princeton, New Jersey isn't five times higher than what you would pay for a Prius in Hackensack or twice the price of a Prius in New Mexico. The price of that car at the very same dealer doesn't depend on your employer, if your self-employed, or unemployed. Why is that the case for healthcare?

The United States spends nearly one-fifth of its gross domestic product on healthcare, more than $3 trillion per year.

H&P - History and Physical - an organized and disciplined form of record keeping that every doctor uses. The H&P is a remarkable template for understanding complex problems, such as sorting out a patient's multitude of symptoms in order to diagnose properly and to allow for effective treatment. The H&P has predictable components:

- Chief complaint - What major symptoms does the patient notice?
- History of the present illness and review of symptoms - How did the problem evolve?
- Diagnosis and treatment - What is the underlying cause? What can be done to resolve the patient's illness or symptoms?

The chief complaint is typically huge, expensive medical care that doesn't reliably deliver quality results.

The economist Adam Smith spoke of an "invisible hand" with respect to income distribution. In American healthcare, there's a different type of invisible hand at work: it's on the till.

## Chapter 1 - The Age of Insurance

Amenities and marketing matter more than good care  

Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear

### The History: In the Beginning

The earliest health policies were designed to compensate for income lost while workers were ill. The original purpose of health insurance was to mitigate financial disasters brought about by serious illness  

The first health care insurance model was called Blue Cross Plans. The goal was not to make profit, but to protect patient savings and keep hospitals afloat  

Once acceptance of health insurance was widespread, a domino effect ensued: hospitals adapted to its financial incentives, which changed how doctors practiced medicine, which revolutionized the types of drugs and devices that manufacturers made and marketed. The money chase was on: no one was protecting the patients.
