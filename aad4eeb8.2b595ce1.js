Engineering culture is a term that is often heard at corporations, but is not specifically defined for those trying to live it.

These behaviors can range from how software is developed, to how documentation is maintained, to how teams handle issues, and how and when work is done."),Object(r.b)("p",null,"While it's important to provide a clear vision and sense of direction for the organization, to expect all employees in a single organization to share exactly the same engineering values and practices is unrealistic. This is why engineering culture should be defined to support the unique needs of separate lines of business across a company.

This is important because there are many areas at many large organizations that do not have definite ownership and responsibilities resulting in operational corrections passed off from team to team.

A simple example of this could be using a server management solution developed in house to control VM servers using attribute tags to deploy an opensource monitoring solution or different agents or configuration settings to those servers.

Ultimately, we need to be responsible for the successes and failures of our applications and using opensource software helps reduce reliance on vendors or external companies. We are not expectant on them to aid us and we eliminate the option to place blame on them when applications are not running as intended. On the flip side of this perspective, while opensource software is often a better option than commercial solutions, that does not mean that it is the end all be all.
