Perhaps in the future that long trend may come to a halt or may even be permanently reversed. First, we must seek to understand the reasons for the ling-run upward trend in all indications: government buying, government transfers, government intervention.<br>
There is no simple or even irrefutable answer. But a backward glance over history suggests these causes:  </p><ul><li>The growing size of business itself has evoked a need for government intervention.  </li><li>Technology has brought a need for public supervision.  </li><li>Urbanization has created a need for centralized administration.  <ul><li>City life has its appeals, but it also has its perils. Men and women cannot live in crowded quarters without police, public health, traffic, sanitation, and educational facilities far more complex than those needed in a rural setting. Government is concentrated in cities. As a nation urbanizes, it requires more government.  </li></ul></li><li>Unification of the economy has given us additional problems.  <ul><li>Problems can no longer be localized. The difficulties of the economy grow in extent: there is need for a national, not local, energy program, for national transportation, urban, and educational programs. Government - largely federal government - is the the principal means by which such problems are handled.  </li></ul></li><li>Economic malfunction has brought public intervention.  <ul><li>Keynes&#x27;s thinking played a very important part in this transition to a mixed economy, and not even the most conservative government today has any intention of returning to a pure laissez-faire system. That is no longer possible.  </li></ul></li><li>We no longer live in a society in which old-age retirement, medical expenses, and income during periods of unemployment are felt to be properly the responsibility of the individuals concerned.  <ul><li>For better or worse, these and similar responsibilities have been gradually assumed by governments in all capitalist nations. In fact, the United States is a laggard in these matters compared with many European capitalist states. Here lie crucial reasons for the swelling of volume of state, local, and federal production and purchase that have steadily enlarged the place of government within the economy.  </li></ul></li></ul><p>In modern capitalism, government is major factor in the economic system.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="five---the-gdp"></a>Five - The GDP<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#five---the-gdp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-gdp-is-made-of"></a>What GDP is Made Of<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-gdp-is-made-of" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The portion of taxes we pay that are used to provide income to individual who cannot find work, or are too infirm to support themselves, or who have reached retirement, is not a reward for effort. It is a form of institutionalized social responsibility that has become part of every advanced nation. It is, in fact, the public equivalent of charity. <em>But because no direct production takes place in exchange for a transfer payment, such as a Social Security check, they are simply left out when GDP is calculated.</em>  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-does-gdp-tell-us"></a>What Does GDP Tell Us?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-does-gdp-tell-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When the value of production rises, more people are likely to be employed. When the value of total output increases, more incomes are sure to be received. That is why, all things considered, a rising GDP is always welcome, and a falling one unwelcome.<br>
Yet, GDP is also a flawed and deceiving measure of our well-being and we should understand the weaknesses as well as the strengths of this most important single economic indicator.<br>
GDP deals in dollar values, not in physical units. Therefore, we have to correct it for inflation.  </p><p>GDP is an accurate indicator of well-being only if we can accurately take out the inflation factor in comparing one year with another. We can partly, but not perfectly.  </p><p>With all its shortcomings, GDP is still the simplest way of summarizing the overall level of activity in the economy.<br>
If we want to examine a country&#x27;s welfare, we need to turn to specific social indicators such as how long people live, how healthy they are, how cheaply they can obtain good medical care, how varied and abundant their diet is, etc. None of those factors can be derived from GDP figures alone.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="six---saving-and-investing"></a>Six - Saving and Investing<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#six---saving-and-investing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Even the most probusiness economist will agree that demand - the willingness and ability to buy goods - is essential for the river of production to flow. Thus, the way to begin our investigation is by examining where demand comes from and what makes it rise or fall.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="household-saving-business-spending"></a>Household Saving, Business Spending<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#household-saving-business-spending" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Here is the first explanation of how GDP grows and why it fluctuates. The explanation is important enough to set apart:  </p><ol><li>Gross domestic product grows because savings that originate in the household sector are converted into capital equipment</li><li>GDP fluctuates because the process of transforming savings into investment is not always smooth or steady.  </li></ol><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="how-the-sectors-interlock"></a>How the Sectors Interlock<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#how-the-sectors-interlock" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>What we do not often realize is that saving has two distinct meanings. The first is putting money aside and not spending it. The second is letting go of or investing those resources.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="the-government-enters"></a>The Government Enters<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-government-enters" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We should bear in mind government provides one absolutely essential service in exchange for its taxes - a service without which no household or business could earn a cent. That is the service of providing law and order and protecting property rights.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="seven---passive-consumption-active-investment"></a>Seven - Passive Consumption, Active Investment<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#seven---passive-consumption-active-investment" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As we have already noted in our last chapter, households altogether regularly spend about ninety-five cents of every dollar they receive and save about five cents.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="eight---the-economics-of-the-public-sector"></a>Eight - The Economics of the Public Sector<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#eight---the-economics-of-the-public-sector" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Why the outcry about the federal government? The reason lies in the tremendous growth in transfer payments. Most of this growth (20 percent since 1960) has gone to finance social security, pensions, and health care for the elderly.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="deficit-spending"></a>Deficit Spending<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#deficit-spending" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Economists who oppose deficit spending strongly would admit that the arguments that equate government with single families or firms are not true.  </p><p>Instead of calling the excess expenditures a deficit, they call it investment.  </p><p>Corporate debt as a whole is very safe.

But unless that currency is 100% convertible into gold, any money demands an act of faith on the part of its users.

Indeed, judged strictly as a source of usable values, gold is rather low on the spectrum of human requirements.  </p><p>Money serves its indispensible purposes as long as we believe in it.

No hard-nosed capitalistic mother or father would ever invest in sixteen years of education for their children. Sixteen years of money in with no money out - the payoffs are too uncertain and too far into the future. No society has ever become literate solely based upon private education. Yet nothing pays off economically for a society more than having an educated work force.<br>
As a result, investments in education, infrastructure, and research and development have to be at least partly financed by governments. <strong>Markets underprovide them.</strong>  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="the-market-in-review"></a>The Market in Review<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-market-in-review" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>First, the market encourages individuals to exert energies, skills, ambitions, and risk-taking in the economic pursuits of life.

In theory the answer is clear: In a purely competitive market, the consumer is king.

We make a trade-off - more expensive drugs today for more drugs tomorrow.  </p><p><em>Note</em>: It is my personal belief that patents <strong>discourage</strong> innovation and <strong>encourage</strong> making minor changes to keep patents to use them, in combination with the law, as a means to keep competition a non factor in the medical space. Refer to An American Sickness for more thoughts on this.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="big-business"></a>Big Business<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#big-business" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Firms make larger profits by driving others out of business and thereby getting a bigger market share. By the logic of the process, those who succeed grow.  </p><p>Despite preaching the virtues of competition, no capitalist firm wants to live in a competitive world, and this is as true of big firms as small ones. The difference is there isn&#x27;t much a small firm can do about it, whereas big business can try - and often succeed to some extent - to put itself &quot;above&quot; the competition.  </p><p>Around the world, governments&#x27; answer to the problem of big business power has been an attempt to restore competition, or at least to lessen the exploitation of consumers, by imposing antitrust laws, various regulations, and public ownership of key industries.  </p><p>Ironically, antitrust legislation is being used today by private companies who wish to sue each other when they think one of their competitors has too much market power. Put bluntly, antitrust laws are now used for more private blackmail than for public purposes.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="small-is-beautiful---sometimes"></a>Small is Beautiful - Sometimes<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#small-is-beautiful---sometimes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Big firms provide most of the markets for small firms. Selling directly to millions of consumers in an era of large retail chains requires advertising budgets beyond the reach of small businesses.  </p><p>Small high-tech firms are often spin-offs from large high-tech firms. A clever employee discovers something that is too small for a large firm to manage efficiently or which does not fit into its overall plans. Such employees take their clever ideas, which they have developed while working in the big firm, and go start up their own small companies. As a result, if the large firms did not exist, many small ones would never come into existence. Thus, large and small companies coexist in a complex symbiosis.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="a-new-social-contract"></a>A New Social Contract?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#a-new-social-contract" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Wage premiums are no longer paid for loyalty or past performance.

They assert that incomes by and large reflect the &quot;marginal productivities&quot; of different contributors to the economic process, which is only a more complicated way of saying that individuals tend to receive incomes that approximate the value of the work they perform for others or for themselves, where &quot;value&quot; depends upon a complicated mixture of an individual&#x27;s supply of talents, skills, drive, risk taking, and hours of leisure forgone relative to the market&#x27;s demand for those same elements.<br>
Does this explanation help us understand the actual distribution of incomes we find in society? The answer is yes and no.  </p><p>Skilled workers make more money than unskilled ones. But there is also a lot more variance in earnings than than measured differences in productive contributions would predict. Good and bad luck - such as being with the right company that is expanding or the wrong company that is downsizing - makes a lot of difference.  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="the-top-and-the-bottom"></a>The Top and the Bottom<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-top-and-the-bottom" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>One characteristic of poverty that stands out immediately is the heavy incidence of poverty among black families and families headed by women. How do economists explain this? They don&#x27;t. They turn to historians and sociologists to explain the current effects of a history of slavery and discrimination and the sharply rising incidence of female-headed families.<br>
Once poor, a vicious poverty trap takes over. People are poor because they don&#x27;t have the skills to be productive, but being poor, they don&#x27;t have the funds to acquire the skills necessary to be productive.  </p><p>Since about half of the superrich have inherited their wealth, individual merit clearly cannot explain much of what is observed. But what about millionaires who have earned their fortunes? Can we explain their wealth by their productive contribution to society? Yes, but not in the conventional way that looks at the marginal productivity of work effort or capital.<br>
<strong>In micro-economic theory, individuals get wealthy by saving, not consuming, and by earning market rates of interest upon those savings.</strong>  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="seventeen---globalization"></a>Seventeen - Globalization<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#seventeen---globalization" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="the-future"></a>The Future<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-future" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Just as macro and micro processes can be curbed and encouraged to yield socially better results than if they were allowed to run their course without legal and social constraints, we see globalization as a process that can be improved by deliberate intervention.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="eighteen---national-policy-in-a-globalized-world"></a>Eighteen - National Policy in a Globalized World<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#eighteen---national-policy-in-a-globalized-world" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="defending-the-dollar"></a>Defending the Dollar<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#defending-the-dollar" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Many economists would say that in the end, the benefits to the economy of having cheaper foreign goods, plus the benefits of moving our own resources and labor away from inefficient uses, outweigh the costs of unemployment. It would be interesting to see if they would come to the same conclusion if we were to import cheaper economists from abroad, asking our domestic practitioners to find another way of making a living.  </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="nineteen---the-unfinished-revolution"></a>Nineteen - The Unfinished Revolution<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#nineteen---the-unfinished-revolution" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="capitalist-revolutions"></a>Capitalist Revolutions<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#capitalist-revolutions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Capitalism brings change because its single most important social class - those who possess or control &quot;capital&quot; - want to put it to use to make a profit.
