title: Risk and Error Budget
---

**Error Budget** - Acknowledges accidents are normal. Error budgets quantify accidents and risks.

A certain amount of risk must be accepted in order to deliver new products and features.  
Amount of acceptable risk is an application driven decision.  

An error budget is a quantitative measurement shared between the product and SRE team. This allows for a balance between development and stability.  

It is important to have error budgets defined from top to bottom, for every component in the application stack. This allows for errors to be budgeted for occurrences that may not be directly related to planned application code or infrastructure changes.  

Trying to achieve 100% availability is unrealistic as it is almost guaranteed application dependencies cannot promise 100% availability.
