title: Elasticsearch Overview
---

Elasticsearch is a real-time, distributed storage, search, and analytic engine. It can be used for multiple purposes, but it excels in indexing streams of semi-structured data, such as logs or decoded network packets.

Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Elasticsearch stores complex data structures as serialized JSON documents, rather than in rows and columnar data.  

When a document is stored, it is indexed and fully searchable in near real-time due to its use of the inverted index data structure.
