You build relationships by having shared experiences.

1. Past experiences
1. Current experiences

So a lot of tech teams, particularly those that have been together for a while, can be very closed off to others. in my experience, this is usually caused by one or a couple of things:

1. Lots of “dead bodies” - the team knows their thing is held together by duct tape and bailing wire, which causes them to be embarrassed by the state of things (or at least not proud of it) which causes them to be hesitant to open up to outsiders. Usually if the thing is “awesome” people are proud to share it.
1. Lack of a transparent culture from leadership. If the team or one level up leaders don’t encourage  transparency, it’s often more likely the team will behave tribally

They get burned a lot by being “thrown under the bus” meaning their words about sensitive situations have been twisted in the past, or they have experienced ‘blameful’ post mortem, and so they are hesitant to open up.

there is no silver bullet, but here are some tactics i’ve used in the past to break down the barriers:

1. Assume positive intent - it’s cliche, but this culture item is huge here. Assume the team is making decisions with the best of  intent, even if it doesn’t seem like it
1. Ask for an overview of how the system works, listen intently, and ask relevant and judgment-free questions.
1. Get in the trenches - Offer to Join the war rooms even if you don't “have to”. Look at the SN ticket backlog, if appropriate resolve some if you can. Dig in on monitoring and operations and propose to make reasonable improvements (target non-contentious things first, things that the team is highly likely to agree with)
1. Offer to take on some of the tasks the team hates - overnight change request, customer support tickets, etc
1. I’m not really a fan of this one, but sometimes it is necessary in the early stages - commiserate with them. Meaning join in the complaining about how some other team let them down, or how some other app is worse. You gotta be careful not to be sucked into the negativity on this one, but this can help build trust early on, and then you can try and influence the conversation towards more positive topics once you are “on the inside”

Trust is built more by asking for help rather than giving help.
